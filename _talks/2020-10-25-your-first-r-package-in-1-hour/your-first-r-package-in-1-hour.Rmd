# Overview

A zoom workshop on introductory R package development for R-Ladies Philly.

# Abstract

This workshop is for people looking to learn how to make their own R packages and learn how to use `usethis` and `devtools` for package development. The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., `usethis::create_package`) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., `devtools::document`). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.

This workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.

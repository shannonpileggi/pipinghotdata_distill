&lt;h1 id="tl-dr"&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manually defined coordinates for &lt;a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_tile.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;geom_rect()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create custom sunbursts with &lt;a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Pair this with &lt;a href="https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ggiraph}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package to create an awesome interactive graphic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunbursts in R first caught my eye from the &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sunburstR/vignettes/sunburst-2-0-0.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sunburstR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package with its amazing interactivity through &lt;code&gt;d3&lt;/code&gt;. However, I had trouble customizing it and sought a &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; alternative. You can create a version using &lt;code&gt;geom_col&lt;/code&gt;, as shown in this &lt;a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-create-a-ggplot2-pie-and-donut-chart-on-same-plot/42798/3" target="_blank"&gt;RStudio Community post&lt;/a&gt;; I chose to go the more complex &lt;code&gt;geom_rect&lt;/code&gt; route for more customization options.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;pretty pumped I got this custom &amp;quot;sunburst&amp;quot;-esque figure to work!!  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ggplot?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ggplot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/L88IQWoVCs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/L88IQWoVCs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Shannon Pileggi (@PipingHotData) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PipingHotData/status/1215699305555746816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id="the-data"&gt;The data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the concept on a publicly available data set, I am using the May 2021 &lt;a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-18/readme.md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#TidyTuesday&lt;/code&gt; salary data&lt;/a&gt;. Here, I’ll be looking at the top 5 industries and their top 5 job titles by number of respondents. I don’t think this visualization is necessarily the best for this data set, I am just using this data as a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data attributes that work well for this visualization include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 categories, with associated weight or frequency of occurrence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our categories are the top 5 industries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 sub-items within each category, with associated weight or frequency of occurrence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our sub-items are the top 5 job titles within industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;optional:&lt;/em&gt; a metric for the sub-items&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our metric is the median salary for the titles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This material was developed using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Software / package&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Version&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;R&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.0.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RStudio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.4.1103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.3.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggiraph&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.7.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;glue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.4.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;pals&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre class="r"&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse) # general use
library(ggiraph)   # interactive ggplots
library(glue)      # pasting strings
library(pals)      # color palette&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id="data-processing"&gt;Data processing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="import"&gt;Import&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, import the data from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="r"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# import data
survey_raw &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-18/survey.csv&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summarize"&gt;Summarize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, summarize the data in terms of the top 5 industries and top 5 job titles. For the job title, we’ll get (1) the percent of respondents with that title, and (2) the median salary for that title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="r"&gt;&lt;code&gt;survey_summary &amp;lt;- survey_raw %&amp;gt;%
  # identify top industries
  group_by(industry) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(# number of respondents per industry
    n_industry = n()) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  arrange(desc(n_industry), industry) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    # rank of industry in terms of number of survey respondents
    # know a better way to do this bit? pls let me know!
    n_industry_rank = as.numeric(factor(-n_industry)),
    # very light cleaning of job title
    job_title = tolower(job_title) %&amp;gt;%
      str_remove_all(&amp;quot;[:digit:]+&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
      ifelse(. == &amp;quot;rn&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;registered nurse&amp;quot;, .) %&amp;gt;%
      str_trim()
  ) %&amp;gt;%
  # reduce to top 5 industries present
  filter(n_industry_rank %in% 1:5) %&amp;gt;%
  # identify top 5 job titles in each industry
  group_by(n_industry_rank, n_industry, industry, job_title) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(# number of titles within industry
    n_title = n(),
    # median salary per title
    median_salary = median(annual_salary)) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  arrange(n_industry_rank, industry, desc(n_title)) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(industry) %&amp;gt;%
  # keep top 5 job titles within industry
  slice(1:5) %&amp;gt;%
  # recompute number of respondents per industry based on titles selected
  mutate(n_industry = sum(n_title)) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    # relative scale of salary for plotting, on 0 - 100 scale
    median_salary_scaled = median_salary / max(median_salary) * 100,
    # base n respondents
    n_total = sum(n_title),
    # percent of respondents per title
    pct_title = n_title / n_total * 100,
    pct_industry = n_industry / n_total * 100,
    # unique job title, as some repeat across industry
    title_unique = glue::glue(&amp;quot;{str_sub(industry, 1, 3)}: {job_title}&amp;quot;)
  ) %&amp;gt;%
  arrange(desc(pct_industry, pct_title))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a preview of our data, which is the basis needed for the sunburst’s custom rectangles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="outer-ring"&gt;Outer ring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I manually define rectangles for the outer ring of the sunburst. I figured out the bits to create custom rectangles from various blog posts that I did not save. It could have been this post on &lt;a href="https://learnr.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/ggplot2-variable-width-column-chart/" target="_blank"&gt;variable width column charts&lt;/a&gt;. I got tips on how to angle text for labels from the &lt;a href="http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/296-add-labels-to-circular-barplot.html" target="_blank"&gt;R Graph Gallery’s circular barplots&lt;/a&gt;; sample code is shown below but not implemented in the figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the rectangles’ color assignment is that darker shades represent more frequent or heavier weight items within a category. To create the colors, I concocted a solution to implement a degree of transparency off of the original industry colors based on the total number of sub-categories. Jake Riley shared with me &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56120815/how-to-factor-sub-group-by-category" target="_blank"&gt;an alternative solution for sub-category color assignment&lt;/a&gt; that he contributed on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="r"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ring_outer &amp;lt;- survey_summary %&amp;gt;%
  # join colors to data frame ----

=======
&lt;p&gt;Well, it is an example! Not quite as aesthetically appealing as my original example shown in the tweet, but it will do to put code to the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we see that the &lt;em&gt;Computing or Tech&lt;/em&gt; industry had the most respondents, and within that industry the most common job title was &lt;em&gt;software engineer&lt;/em&gt;. The median salary of &lt;em&gt;software engineer&lt;/em&gt; was $125,000, which was less than the next most common job title of &lt;em&gt;senior software engineer&lt;/em&gt;, with a median salary of $151,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I think this figure can be eye-catching, it is challenging to make it informative with labeling and still maintain appeal. For this reason, I have omitted labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fixed-length-sunburst"&gt;Fixed length sunburst&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a simpler alternative, drop the job title metric of median salary and only show the frequency of industry and title in survey respondents by fixing the rectangle height. This figure can effectively communicate parts of a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;h1 id="tl-dr"&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I curated the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@WeAreRLadies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; twitter account from Feb 15 - 20, 2021. During my curation, I shared brief R code gifs created with &lt;a href="https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;xaringan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;flipbookr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bit of custom CSS, and the &lt;a href="https://www.screentogif.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ScreenToGif&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recorder. Full code is available in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/shannonpileggi/rladies-flipbookr" target="_blank"&gt;rladies-flipbookr&lt;/a&gt; repo; here is an example gif:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2021-03-08-r-ladies-styled-code-gifs-with-xaringan-and-flipbookrgifs/demo-walrus-flipbook-quality.gif" alt="Walrus operator gif. You can read more about this topic at https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/02/glue-strings-and-tidy-eval/."  /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This material was developed using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Software / package&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Version&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;R&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.0.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RStudio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.4.1103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.3.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;xaringan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;flipbookr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1 id="creating-slides"&gt;Creating slides&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;flipbookr&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr#template" target="_blank"&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to quickly create content! I used the classic flipbook, with defaults to walk through the code pipeline (slides 3-4 in the template).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a flipbook slide that advances code line by line, create a named R code chunk with the &lt;code&gt;include = FALSE&lt;/code&gt; option, and then present the code chunk with &lt;code&gt;flipbookr::chunk_reveal&lt;/code&gt;. The order of defining the chunk versus revealing the chunk does not matter in your RMarkdown document. Longer content was broken into multiple code chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;`r chunk_reveal("walrus", title = "## Walrus operator")`&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r walrus, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rlang)
library(glue)

suffix &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; 

dat &amp;lt;- tibble(x = 1:5) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    &amp;quot;x_{suffix}&amp;quot; := x
  ) 

dat %&amp;gt;% 
  dplyr::select(
    glue::glue(&amp;quot;x_{suffix}&amp;quot;)
    ) 
```&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id="styling-slides"&gt;Styling slides&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first styled the content used Alison Hill’s &lt;a href="https://alison.rbind.io/project/rladies-xaringan/" target="_blank"&gt;R-Ladies xaringan theme&lt;/a&gt; by declaring R-Ladies CSS options in the &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;css: ["default", "rladies", "rladies-fonts"]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;resulting in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2021-03-08-r-ladies-styled-code-gifs-with-xaringan-and-flipbookrimg/walrus-default.PNG" alt="Flipbookr walrus operator content styled with R-Ladies xaringan theme." width="834" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the highlighting shade was a tad too dark for me, and I was concerned that the font size would be too small to be legible in a gif on twitter. I updated the CSS with bits lifted from &lt;a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources" target="_blank"&gt;xaringan templates&lt;/a&gt; and some modifications on font size and color kindly developed by &lt;a href="https://silvia.rbind.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Silvia Canelón&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2021-03-08-r-ladies-styled-code-gifs-with-xaringan-and-flipbookrwalrus-adjusted.png" alt="Flipbookr walrus operator content styled with R-Ladies xaringan theme adjusted with lighter highlight shade and larger font size." width="768" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;
(#fig:unnamed-chunk-3)Flipbookr walrus operator content styled with R-Ladies xaringan theme adjusted with lighter highlight shade and larger font size.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are subtle, but I hope they improve readability! The increased font size did create a challenge for code formatting and for the amount of code that could be shown on a single slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silvia showed me how to modify the CSS through (1) inclusion of a CSS code chunk, and (2) calling a &lt;a href="https://github.com/shannonpileggi/rladies-flipbookr/blob/main/css/rladies-adjusted.css" target="_blank"&gt;separate CSS sheet&lt;/a&gt;. For option (2), change the yaml to point to your custom CSS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;css: ["default", "default-fonts", "css/rladies-adjusted.css"]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the full code for the default xaringan theme and the two ways of adjusting the CSS for all the gifs I created in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/shannonpileggi/rladies-flipbookr" target="_blank"&gt;shannonpileggi/rladies-flipbookr&lt;/a&gt; github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have configured a GitHub personal access token, you can fork and clone this repo with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="r"&gt;&lt;code&gt;usethis::create_from_github(&amp;quot;shannonpileggi/rladies-flipbookr&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id="recording-the-gif"&gt;Recording the gif&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recorded the gifs by manually advancing the slides with the screen recorder &lt;a href="https://www.screentogif.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ScreenToGif&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (for Windows OS). Bryan Shalloway has some code to &lt;a href="https://github.com/brshallo/flipbookr-gifs-examples" target="_blank"&gt;automatically create gifs from xaringan slides&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn’t go that route this time - maybe next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="code-gifs-shared"&gt;Code gifs shared&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the R code gifs that I shared on twitter during my &lt;code&gt;@WeAreRLadies&lt;/code&gt; curating week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1361802517735178243" target="_blank"&gt;walrus operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1363286611971170304" target="_blank"&gt;named color vectors + scale_color_manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="other-options"&gt;Other options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my curating week, I learned about the &lt;a href="https://github.com/yonicd/carbonate" target="_blank"&gt;carbonate&lt;/a&gt; package! This also seems like a fantastic option for aesthetically appealing code sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="accessibility"&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual code sharing through gifs and images can be a great way to share content! However, please remember to share the content with everyone. Gifs and images on their own are not accessible to members of our community that use assistive technology to read digital content. In order to make gifs and images accessible to screen readers, you can include &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions" target="_blank"&gt;descriptions&lt;/a&gt; or share code in otherwise accessible formats like &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub gists&lt;/a&gt;. If I miss making any of my content accessible, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
Added April 3, 2020: This &lt;a href="https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; provides a framework for how to write alt text for data visualization. In addition, you can install &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-required-alt-text/fpjlpckbikddocimpfcgaldjghimjiik/related" target="_blank"&gt;chrome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-required-alt-text/" target="_blank"&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; browser plugins to prevent yourself from tweeting an image without alt text.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;h1 id="acknowledgements"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to give &lt;a href="https://silvia.rbind.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Silvia Canelón&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spcanelon" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@spcanelon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; shout out here. My curating week started on a Monday, and on Monday night I was still trying to figure out how I wanted to style my code. We chatted on &lt;a href="https://rladies-community-slack.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;R-Ladies slack&lt;/a&gt;, and she quickly helped me make CSS adjustments to the default xaringan R-Ladies theme. After the curating week, Silvia helped me fine tune the bits to share that are now in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/shannonpileggi/rladies-flipbookr" target="_blank"&gt;rladies-flipbookr&lt;/a&gt; repo. Additionally, she advises me on inclusivity and accessibility best practices, which I am still striving to meet. Thank you, Silvia! 💜 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, thanks to the friendly &lt;a href="https://community.rstudio.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RStudio Community&lt;/a&gt; forum for helping me figure out both the &lt;a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/rmarkdown-verbatim-in-line-code/98165" target="_blank"&gt;in line verbatim&lt;/a&gt; I used in this post and the &lt;a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/tidy-eval-glue-custom-names-w-dplyr-select/95010" target="_blank"&gt;dplyr::select() portion&lt;/a&gt; of the walrus operator gif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="outtakes"&gt;Outtakes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented with, and actually recorded, some alternative formats before I landed on &lt;code&gt;flipbookr&lt;/code&gt;. Here are two gifs that didn’t make the cut! 🙈&lt;/p&gt;

We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or purrr::map_ (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.). Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the purrr::map_ family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We demonstrate handy functions in usethis and devtools, strategies for writing tests, debugging techniques, and broad concepts in function writing that facilitate a smoother testing process.\r\nThis workshop picks up exactly where we left our little ralph (aka R-Ladies Philly) package one year ago with ‚ÄúYour first R package in 1 hour: Tools that make R package development easy‚Äù. Participants will get the most out of this workshop if they review those materials in advance, or if they are already familiar with building R packages with devtools and usethis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Serving as a rotating curator on a Twitter account with thousands of followers may seem daunting, but it is a great opportunity to share your knowledge, connect with others with similar interests, and learn something in return. In this talk, I‚Äôll discuss how I planned ahead for my @WeAreRLadies curation week, what happened the week of, and the good things that followed.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nI am grateful to Alison Hill, Ale Segura, Katherine Simeon, and Megan McClintock for their feedback, at various stages, on this content! üíú\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In this presentation, I‚Äôll discuss how I crafted a job interview presentation by making modifications on publicly available TidyTuesday code. This built the technical and confidence-boosting scaffolding I needed for more open-ended projects. The success of this experience inspired me to transition from my role as a consumer and creator to contributor to give back to the R community, which has been incredibly fulfilling. Despite social distancing, I feel more connected to the R community than ever before!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., usethis::create_package) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., devtools::document). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.\r\nThis workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

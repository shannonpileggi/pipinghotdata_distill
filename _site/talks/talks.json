Data documentation is the key to unlocking this understanding; with minimal effort, this documentation can be natively embedded in R data frames via variable labels. Variable labels seamlessly provide valuable data context that reduces human error, fosters collaboration, and ultimately elevates the overall data analysis experience. As an avid, daily user of variable labels, I am excited to help you discover new workflows to create and leverage variable labels in R!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Serving as a rotating curator on a Twitter account with thousands of followers may seem daunting, but it is a great opportunity to share your knowledge, connect with others with similar interests, and learn something in return. In this talk, Iâ€™ll discuss how I planned ahead for my @WeAreRLadies curation week, what happened the week of, and the good things that followed.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nI am grateful to Alison Hill, Ale Segura, Katherine Simeon, and Megan McClintock for their feedback, at various stages, on this content! ðŸ’œ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In this presentation, Iâ€™ll discuss how I crafted a job interview presentation by making modifications on publicly available TidyTuesday code. This built the technical and confidence-boosting scaffolding I needed for more open-ended projects. The success of this experience inspired me to transition from my role as a consumer and creator to contributor to give back to the R community, which has been incredibly fulfilling. Despite social distancing, I feel more connected to the R community than ever before!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In this presentation, I’ll discuss how I crafted a job interview presentation by making modifications on publicly available TidyTuesday code. This built the technical and confidence-boosting scaffolding I needed for more open-ended projects. The success of this experience inspired me to transition from my role as a consumer and creator to contributor to give back to the R community, which has been incredibly fulfilling. Despite social distancing, I feel more connected to the R community than ever before!\r\n⚡ abbreviated for an R-Ladies Philly lightning talk June 16, 2021 Leveraging the R community for a job interview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., usethis::create_package) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., devtools::document). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.\r\nThis workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My previous work experiences include supporting research on\r\nparasitic diseases at the CDC, contributing to curriculum development at\r\nthe Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University,\r\nand instructing advanced programming and modeling courses at California\r\nPolytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I am currently a Data\r\nScientist at The Prostate\r\nCancer Clinical Trials Consortium, housed under Memorial Sloan Kettering\r\nCancer Center, working remotely from my home in Doylestown, PA.\r\nR-Ladies\r\nR-Ladies promotes\r\ngender diversity in the R community, and I highly recommend joining the\r\ncommunity slack. My home chapter is R-Ladies\r\nPhilly.\r\nPersonal\r\nI have two daughters, one of which is my alarm clock and the other is\r\nmy midnight collaborator. My partner\r\nis incredibly supportive and inspirational, and we exchange ideas on\r\ndata and R programming. I’ve won many coveted recreational soccer league\r\nChampion t-shirts, and on the weekends we like to cruise around\r\non our bikes. On the rare occasions when both children are asleep and we\r\naren’t working or talking about data, you’ll find us relaxing with adult\r\nbeverages and board games.\r\nContact\r\nWant to chat?

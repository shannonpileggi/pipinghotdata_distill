My previous work experiences include supporting research on parasitic diseases at the CDC, contributing to curriculum development at the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University, and instructing advanced programming and modeling courses at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I am currently a Senior Statistician at Adelphi Research in Doylestown, PA working in pharmaceutical market research.\r\nR-Ladies\r\nR-Ladies promotes gender diversity in the R community, and I highly recommend joining the community slack. My home chapter is R-Ladies Philly.\r\nPersonal\r\nI have two daughters, one of which is my alarm clock and the other is my midnight collaborator. My partner is incredibly supportive and inspirational, and we exchange ideas on data and R programming. I’ve won many coveted recreational soccer league Champion t-shirts, and on the weekends we like to cruise around on our bikes. On the rare occasions when both children are asleep and we aren’t working or talking about data, you’ll find us relaxing with adult beverages and board games.\r\nContact\r\nWant to chat? Go ahead, pipe up! Feel free to contact me on email, Twitter, or LinkedIn. I hope to hear from you!\r\nR feeds\r\nThis blog feeds into R Weekly.

target="_blank"&gt;particpants&lt;/a&gt; photographed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tl-dr"&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August of 2023 I traveled to the University of Warwick in
Coventry, England to participate in the &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/"
target="_blank"&gt;R Project Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, where I worked collaboratively on
contributions to base R alongside novice and experienced contributors,
as well as the R Core Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="about"&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code for base R is a mixture of R and C code. The bug
fixes, maintenance, and enhancement of this code base is upheld by
volunteers. Those who make the executive decisions are the &lt;a
href="https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html" target="_blank"&gt;R
Core Team&lt;/a&gt;; however, community members are still encouraged to
contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the R Project Sprint as I perceive it was to foster
mentorship, collaborations, and personal relationships between the
novice and experienced contributors, reducing the barrier to one’s first
contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is describe my personal experience at this
event; a comprehensive guide for how contribute to base R is documented
on the &lt;a href="https://contributor.r-project.org/" target="_blank"&gt;R
Contribution Working Group website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="applying-to-participate"&gt;Applying to participate&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/"
target="_blank"&gt;Applications to participate&lt;/a&gt; in the event were due in
March 2023, and later that month I was notified of my acceptance. The
expectations for participants’ knowledge base coming into the event was
nicely outlined in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="prior-to-the-event"&gt;Prior to the event&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the event there was communication about optional things
we could do to prepare, most of which is available at the &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/" target="_blank"&gt;R Contribution
Working Group website&lt;/a&gt;. This included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining the &lt;a href="https://contributor.r-project.org/slack"
target="_blank"&gt;R Contributors slack group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participating in &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/events/" target="_blank"&gt;online
events&lt;/a&gt; such as a C book club for R Contributors and R Contributor
office hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching recorded &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/tutorials/"
target="_blank"&gt;tutorials and demonstrations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submitting &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/ideas-and-proposals.html"
target="_blank"&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; for topics to tackle during the
Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="participants"&gt;Participants&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/participants/"
target="_blank"&gt;R Project Sprint participants&lt;/a&gt; were impressively
diverse both in terms of professional experience and geographic
residence. A non-exhaustive list of countries represented at the
in-person event includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, England, India,
Hungary, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Senegal,
Switzerland, and United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals participated remotely via video conference, either
by choice or circumstance. The combination of &lt;a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66637156" target="_blank"&gt;the United
Kingdom’s air traffic control issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66479059" target="_blank"&gt;train
strikes&lt;/a&gt; caused delayed arrival for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="during-the-event"&gt;During the event&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues addressed at the event fell into four broad
categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/translation/"
target="_blank"&gt;Translation&lt;/a&gt; of messages, errors, and
warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/documentation/"
target="_blank"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing bug reports, such as those related to the &lt;a
href="https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/33"
target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;stats&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancements, such as &lt;a
href="https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/75"
target="_blank"&gt;logging visual outcomes from base graphics
calls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="knowledge-requirements-for-contributions"&gt;Knowledge requirements
for contributions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the task at hand, the technical requirements for
contributions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read R source code and understand function implementation
(documentation and translation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read, modify, or write R source code (bugs and
enhancements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read, modify, or write C source code (bugs and
enhancements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="workflows-for-contributions"&gt;Workflows for contributions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, the progress on these items was tracked at &lt;a
href="https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues"
target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues&lt;/a&gt;.
Either the initial report or the final resolution of these items may be
seen in the R Bug Tracking System, known as &lt;a
href="https://bugs.r-project.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the nature of the proposed change, the contributor may
need to build R from source. The instructions regarding how to do so on
your personal computing enviroment are outlined in the &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/GetStart.html"
target="_blank"&gt;R Patched and Development Versions Chapter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/index.html"
target="_blank"&gt;R Development Guide&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, one could also
build R from source without touching their local computing environment
using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env"
target="_blank"&gt;GitHub Code Space R Dev Container&lt;/a&gt; (which I heard
facilitated collaboration nicely as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you needed to build R from source, proposed
changes could then be tested on multiple computing platforms via a pull
request to &lt;a href="https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn"
target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn&lt;/a&gt;, which mirrors the
official base R server. After tests have passed, the contributor could
extract the diff from the pull request to submit a proposed solution via
Bugzilla; this process is more thoroughly documented in the &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/FixBug.html#using-a-git-mirror"
target="_blank"&gt;Using a git mirror section&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/index.html"
target="_blank"&gt;R Development Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a proposal is submitted, member(s) of the R core team review. If
the proposed change modifies the code base, additional checks are run
against all packages on CRAN (which there are currently ~20,000) to
determine if any breaking changes are enacted, which takes &amp;gt;14 hours
to complete. If breaking changes are found, a possible resolution could
include re-writing the code to avoid breaking changes. If that is not
possible, the R Core Team would then assess if the breaking changes are
good breaking changes for packages (i.e., code could have been returning
possibly incorrect results and should indeed break and be addressed) or
if the breaking changes have too wide of a reach and minimal impact to
be considered worth it. If it is decided that breaking changes should be
enacted, the R Core Team notifies all authors of affected packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bugs-personally-addressed"&gt;Bugs personally addressed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my time at the Sprint on two bugs that genuinely
intrigued me as there were related to functions I had used often over
the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;base::paste&lt;/code&gt; documentation, discussed in &lt;a
href="https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17933"
target="_blank"&gt;bug 17933&lt;/a&gt; and tested in &lt;a
href="https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/138"&gt;r-devel PR138&lt;/a&gt;.
Opened in 2020, there was already substantial nuanced discussion on this
issue related to the clarity and correctness of the documentation
regarding the &lt;code&gt;collapse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;recycle0&lt;/code&gt; behaviors.
It took me a substantial amount of time to understand and evaluate the
scenarios discussed and propose changes. After my initial proposal, I
received several rounds of feedback both from fellow R contributors and
the R core team that provided additional suggestions and context for the
documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;stats::t.test&lt;/code&gt; bug, discussed in &lt;a
href="https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14359"
target="_blank"&gt;bug 14359&lt;/a&gt; and tested in &lt;a
href="https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/142" target="_blank"&gt;r-devel
PR142&lt;/a&gt;. Opened in 2010, there was again already substantial
discussion on the both the implementation of the paired t-test and the
examples shown in the documentation. This was again a collaboration
among several individuals to both modify the source code and improve
documentation that had several rounds of iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="outcomes"&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both me personally and for the wider R community, I view the
event as a huge success. Many friendships were made, many collaborations
were born, and many bug fixes and enhancements were implemented
throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time zone differences and personal availability among the R Core Team
and contributors can lead to time lags in communications, losing
momentum for initiated issues. Having contributors in person together
facilitated live and immediate feedback, allowing for faster iteration
and completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can now confidently either submit a new bug report or address an
existing bug report. Moreover, I understand workflows for contributions,
resources for help, and how to interact with the community for help
should I get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also begin attending the R Contribution Working Group (RCWG)
as a representative of R-Ladies to communicate RCWG highlights to the
broader R-Ladies community and engage in RCWG initiatives as able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned from R Core Team members that have been contributing to
base R since 1997, and who knows, maybe I just shared a dinner, chatted
over coffee, or walked around campus with a future R Core Team member.

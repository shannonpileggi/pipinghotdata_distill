I’m a southern girl who was never quite cool enough for California still learning how to navigate personalities in the northeast. 😂\r\nI do have two additional short-term residences not shown here. Although I was born in Raleigh, NC, I lived in Accra, Ghana until I was 1 year old (my father served in the US military and worked at the American Embassy in Accra). I also lived in Seville, Spain for a semester abroad during college.\r\nIn this gif I did not include transitions between countries (because, you know, I’m a parent working in a pandemic and I have to draw the line on my free time somewhere). In addition, aligning sizing with resolution of the output device took some experimentation.\r\nI would love to get to know you through your gif - if you happen to replicate this for yourself please share with me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or email! I also invite you to improve this gif with cooler transitions, international locations, awesome styles, or anything else. 😀 💜\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The gmailr and httr packages, and the Google Books API, allowed me to create a catalog of the books we read with preview images. You can skip straight to the books, or read on for code that follows these main steps with their primary packages.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nI live in Doylestown, PA (Bucks County), with my husband and two daughters (2 and 5 years old). On March 14, 2020, the Bucks County library system closed due to COVID-19; on June 22, 2020, the library opened with curbside pick-up service. Every one to two weeks, I began to place children’s books on hold (up to 15 at a time), and when a hold arrives, I receive an email notice like this:\r\n\r\nEmail notifications are sent around midnight, collating any books that arrived that day. As the email notifications trickled in and patterns emerged, I conceptualized a project to programmatically create a catalog of the library books we had placed on hold by extracting the books from my gmail and then augmenting their information from an API.\r\nGetting started\r\nThis material was developed using:\r\nSoftware / package\r\nVersion\r\nR\r\n4.0.3\r\nRStudio\r\n1.3.1073\r\ntidyverse\r\n1.3.0\r\ngmailr\r\n1.0.0\r\nhttr\r\n1.4.2\r\nlubridate\r\n1.7.8\r\ngt\r\n0.2.2\r\nglue\r\n1.4.1\r\nDT\r\n0.15\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse) # general use ----\r\nlibrary(gmailr)    # retrieve emails  ----\r\nlibrary(httr)      # access api ----\r\nlibrary(lubridate) # repair dates ----\r\nlibrary(gt)        # for web_image helper function ----\r\nlibrary(glue)      # paste strings ----  \r\nlibrary(DT)        # interactive table ----  \r\n\r\n1 {gmailr} retrieve library notifications from gmail\r\nI followed the gmailr set up instructions to authenticate myself and enable R’s gmailr package to interact with the Gmail API for my personal Gmail account, which was fairly straightforward. This required some point and click in other interfaces, followed by two lines of R code.\r\n\r\n\r\ngm_auth_configure(path = \"path/credentials.json\")\r\ngm_auth()\r\n\r\nOnce authenticated, I retrieved the email notifications from my gmail account. It was not immediately clear to me how to do this, but this stack overflow thread helped.\r\n\r\n\r\n# 1 - retrieve messages corresponding to this search ----\r\nmessages <- gmailr::gm_messages(\"Bucks County Library System - Available Hold Pickup Notice\")\r\n\r\n# 2 - extract ids from messages corresponding to search ----\r\nmessage_ids <- gmailr::gm_id(messages)\r\n\r\n# 3 - extract contents from messages with these ids -----\r\nmessage_full <- purrr::map(message_ids, gmailr::gm_message)\r\n\r\n# 4 - extract message body from contents -----\r\nmessage_body <- purrr::map(message_full, gmailr::gm_body)\r\n\r\nThis resulted in 67 email notifications from June 22, 2020 to December 30, 3020, containing from 1 to 11 books per email. Here is an example character string returned to me, corresponding to the email notification shown above.\r\n\r\n\r\nmessage_body[[66]]\r\n\r\n[1] \"Wednesday, June 24, 2020\\r\\n\\r\\nBCFL Doylestown Branch\\r\\n150 South Pine Street\\r\\nDoylestown, PA\\r\\n18901-4932\\r\\n215-348-9081\\r\\n\\r\\n          Shannon M Pileggi\\r\\n          \\r\\n          Doylestown, PA\\r\\n          18901\\r\\n          \\r\\n\\r\\nDear Shannon Pileggi,\\r\\n                     \\\"AVAILABLE HOLD PICKUP NOTICE\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGood news!

Daywalt, Drew. call number:E FICTION DAYWALT copy:\r\nThe day the crayons quit\r\nDrew Daywalt\r\n\r\n3 {httr} query google books api\r\nI then got started with the Google Books API. Some key steps in this process included:\r\nExploring Google Books and doing some manual searches to get a feel for how it behaves and what it returns.\r\nIdentifying the format to get started with the API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/{collectionName}/resourceID?parameters.\r\nUnderstanding the search terms permissible in the query (like inauthor and intitle): https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms.\r\nObtaining an API key (google console developer -> enable google books api -> create credentials -> calling API from other non UI -> get API key). However, this ended up being unnecessary for the search I executed.\r\nThen I used the httr package to actually perform the query. First, I defined the url.\r\n\r\n\r\n# url base format ----\r\nurl <- \"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes\"\r\n\r\nNext I created a wrapper function around httr::GET to allow for a search by title and author, or title alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nget_book <- function(this_title, this_author = NA){\r\n  httr::GET(\r\n    url = url,\r\n    query = list(\r\n      key = token, \r\n      q = ifelse(\r\n        is.na(this_author),\r\n        glue::glue('intitle:{this_title}'),\r\n        glue::glue('intitle:{this_title}+inauthor:{this_author}')\r\n        )))\r\n}\r\n\r\nI then performed an initial search with title and author. I learned that the API would error out with too many queries in quick succession, and I included Sys.sleep to slow down the search.\r\n\r\n\r\n# first search with title and author ----\r\n# create progress bar for mapping ----\r\np <- dplyr::progress_estimated(nrow(books))\r\nbooks_1 <- books %>%\r\n  mutate(book_info = purrr::map2(title, author,\r\n                                 function(x, y) {\r\n                                   # print progress bar ----\r\n                                   p$tick()$print()\r\n                                   # add in delay for api ----\r\n                                   Sys.sleep(1)\r\n                                   get_book(x, y)\r\n                                 }))\r\n\r\nFrom there, I checked the status code, extracted book content, and checked to see if any items were empty (which meant that no result was returned). In addition, more than one search result could have been returned; only the first was extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\nbooks_1_content <- books_1 %>%\r\n  mutate(\r\n    # extract status code: 200 = success ----\r\n    status_code = purrr::map_int(book_info, \"status_code\"),\r\n    # extract relevant content from author title search ----\r\n    book_items = purrr::map(book_info, ~ httr::content(.x)[[\"items\"]][[1]][[\"volumeInfo\"]]),\r\n    # check to see if items are empty ----\r\n    empty_items = purrr::map_lgl(book_items, rlang::is_empty)\r\n  )\r\n\r\nThe initial title and author search were all technically successful, though 10 searches results in empty items.\r\n\r\n\r\nbooks_1_content %>% count(status_code, empty_items)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 2 x 3\r\n  status_code empty_items     n\r\n        <int> <lgl>       <int>\r\n1         200 FALSE         204\r\n2         200 TRUE           10\r\n\r\nFor these 10 items, I manually checked some with various searches on Google Books, and I noticed that some actually did have an entry, but did not have an author in that entry, so I repeated the search but with title only.\r\n\r\n\r\n# 10 books did not have a result with author title search ----\r\np <- dplyr::progress_estimated(nrow(books))\r\n# perform title search only ----\r\nbooks_2 <- books_1_content %>%\r\n  # keep only empty items for another search ----\r\n  filter(empty_items == TRUE) %>%\r\n  # keep original first six columns ----\r\n  select(1:6) %>%\r\n  mutate(book_info = purrr::map(title, \r\n                                function(x) {\r\n                                  p$tick()$print()\r\n                                  Sys.sleep(1)\r\n                                  get_book(x)\r\n                                }))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbooks_2_content <- books_2 %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    # extract status code: 200 = success ----\r\n    status_code = purrr::map_int(book_info, \"status_code\"),\r\n    # extract relevant content from author only search ----  \r\n    book_items = purrr::map(book_info, ~ httr::content(.x)[[\"items\"]][[1]][[\"volumeInfo\"]]\r\n  ),\r\n  # check to see if items are empty ----  \r\n  empty_items = purrr::map_lgl(book_items, rlang::is_empty)\r\n)\r\n\r\nThese 10 items were all technically successful and contained result contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nbooks_2_content %>% count(status_code, empty_items)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\r\n  status_code empty_items     n\r\n        <int> <lgl>       <int>\r\n1         200 FALSE          10\r\n\r\nIn these two searches, I created a nested tibble with two nested lists:\r\nbook_info is a very long list which contains the full result from the original query.\r\n\r\n\r\n# showing entry for a book in initial email notification ----\r\nbooks_1_content[[\"book_info\"]][[2]]\r\n\r\nResponse [https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?key=AIzaSyCUqoG382nRpWFTT-3BKX-m_cB7UyfVTMw&q=intitle%3AMy%20trip%20to%20the%20science%20museum%2Binauthor%3AMercer%20Mayer]\r\n  Date: 2021-01-03 16:42\r\n  Status: 200\r\n  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\r\n  Size: 6.14 kB\r\n{\r\n  \"kind\": \"books#volumes\",\r\n  \"totalItems\": 2,\r\n  \"items\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"kind\": \"books#volume\",\r\n      \"id\": \"htdVvgAACAAJ\",\r\n      \"etag\": \"zxSYXCOb+ho\",\r\n      \"selfLink\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/htdV...\r\n      \"volumeInfo\": {\r\n...\r\n\r\nbook_items contains into the specific bits of information I considered for extraction to augment book information.\r\n\r\n\r\n# showing entry for a book in initial email notification ----\r\nstr(books_1_content[[\"book_items\"]][[2]])\r\n\r\nList of 19\r\n $ title              : chr \"My Trip to the Science Museum\"\r\n $ authors            :List of 1\r\n  ..$ : chr \"Mercer Mayer\"\r\n $ publisher          : chr \"Little Critter\"\r\n $ publishedDate      : chr \"2017-03-07\"\r\n $ description        : chr \"For use in schools and libraries only.

reflection\r\nThis project was certainly a learning experience! I used the gmailr and httr packages for the first time, in addition to accessing my first API. Here are some of the challenges I faced:\r\nMy emails from the library did not always have consistent punctuation in reporting available books.\r\nBook titles are not consistently presented; e.g., Up up up down in my email from the library vs Up, Up, Up, Down! in the Google Books result.\r\nAuthor names can be formatted differently across books (books with multiple authors or authors who identify with a middle initial, and period, in their name).\r\nAuthorship is not always consistently defined. For example, I Can Read! Splat the Cat and the Quick Chicks was attributed to Laura Driscoll according to the library (who actually wrote the text), but Rob Scotton according to Google Books (who wrote the original Splat the Cat books that this was based on).\r\nThe API results varied in information presented; for example, not all results contained authors or preview images.\r\nPerforming the API search in two phases (author and title vs title only) gave eight additional correct results and five additional incorrect results. I’m not sure if that is worth it considering the manual effort to identify the incorrect results.\r\nThe books shown in my search are not necessarily the exact books that I read. For example, I did not read the 2021 edition of “What the Ladybird Heard” as shown in my final table, which would not have been available when I read it in October 2020.\r\nI encountered more issues with NULL, integer(0), and empty items than ever before (which is not the same as NA 🤣).\r\nAlternative solutions to these challenges are welcome! You can download books.rda (which contains message_body, books_1, and books_2) from my github repo.\r\nPersonal note\r\nLike many aspects of life, COVID-19 changed our relationship with the library. Previously, our family library experience consisted of leisurely browsing for a couple of books followed by a quick exit when the girls inevitably started playing hide and seek in the aisles. Instead, I now actively research children’s books to check out. Without this change, I may have not have encountered many books that we now treasure. Completion of this cataloging project with preview images allows us to better recall the books we read together, and decide together which books we want to read again in the future. I hope that nurturing a love for books and reading can help to alleviate the lapse in formal pre-k education my children experienced this year.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nAnthony Pileggi (my husband) talked me through my first API and discussed possible solutions to some coding challenges. Anthony is a data scientist currently specializing in e-commerce for outdoor power equipment at Paul B. Moyer and Sons, and sometimes he makes fun R packages like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Here are my most used functions for getting started with labelled data:\r\nPurpose\r\nFunction\r\n1. Import SPSS labelled data\r\nhaven::read_sav()\r\n2. Create data dictionary\r\nlabelled::look_for(details = TRUE)\r\n3. Identify if variable is haven_labelled\r\nhaven::is.labelled()\r\n4. Convert haven_labelled variables to numeric\r\nbase::as.numeric()\r\n5. Convert haven_labelled variables to factors\r\nhaven::as_factor()\r\n6. Convert variable label to variable name\r\nsjlabelled::label_to_colnames()\r\nIntroduction\r\nLabelled data traditionally, though not exclusively, arises in survey data. SAS, SPSS, and Stata have established infrastructures for labelled data, which consists of metadata in the form of variable and value labels. This post is for R users who already have a SPSS (.sav), SAS (.sas7bdat), or Stata (.dta) data file and want to incorporate the labelled data features into their R workflow. With R’s haven, labelled, and sjlabelled packages, you can leverage the inherent data labelling structure in these data sets to work interactively with variable and value labels, making it easier to navigate data while also allowing the user to convert metadata to data. This post discusses general characteristics of labelled data and practical tips for data analysis with labelled data.\r\n\r\nI work exclusively with SPSS (.sav) data files, and so I have not evaluated this process on SAS (.sas7bdat) or Stata (.dta) data files. 🤞 everything works the same!\r\nYRBSS labelled data\r\nThe Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is a publicly available data set from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that “monitors health-related behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death and disability among youth and adults.” On Aug 9, 2020, I downloaded YRBSS materials from the CDC website. This site has both the the 2017 national data (sadc_2017_national.dat) and the SPSS syntax to convert the .dat file to an SPSS labelled data file (2017_sadc_spss_input_program.sps). I do have an SPSS license, and I used the SPSS syntax to convert the .dat file to an SPSS labelled data file (sadc_2017_national.sav). As the .sav data file is not available on the CDC site, you can download the .sav data from my github repo.\r\nGetting started\r\nThis material was developed using:\r\nSoftware / package\r\nVersion\r\nR\r\n4.0.3\r\nRStudio\r\n1.3.1073\r\ntidyverse\r\n1.3.0\r\nhere\r\n0.4.8\r\nhaven\r\n2.3.1\r\nlabelled\r\n2.5.0\r\nsjlabelled\r\n1.1.7\r\n\r\nAs of Dec 23, 2020, the most current version of the labelled package is 2.7.0. I am using labelled 2.5.0 due to an issue I encountered with 2.7.0 and the look_for function. You can install older versions of a package. I’ll update this post when the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # general use ----\r\nlibrary(here)       # file paths  ----\r\nlibrary(haven)      # import .sav files ----  \r\nlibrary(labelled)   # tools for labelled data ----\r\nlibrary(sjlabelled) # more tools for labelled data ----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImporting labelled data\r\nI use the haven package to import SPSS (.sav) data files.\r\n\r\n\r\n# import data ----\r\ndat_raw <- haven::read_sav(here::here( \"_posts\", \"2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r\", \"data\", \"sadc_2017_national.sav\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariables in a data set have a class, which consists of assignments like numeric, character, and factor, among others. When labelled features are present, the haven package assigns a class of haven_labelled. This is important to know as many packages you work with may not have methods for haven_labelled objects.\r\nWhen I first started working with SPSS data files, I also explored the foreign package, which preceeds haven. Using foreign takes a bit longer than haven, can result in truncation of long character variables, and produces a different labelled data structure compared to haven. I have a strong preference for the haven package.\r\nCreating a data dictionary\r\nA data dictionary contains metadata about your data. The labelled::look_for function can be used to create a data dictionary, extracted straight from your data. The usefulness of the data dictionary depends on the quality of your metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\n# create data dictionary ----\r\ndictionary <- labelled::look_for(dat_raw, details = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is a data frame in my R environment with the number of observations equal to number of variables in the original data set. I can interactively explore the dictionary in R to quickly find variables or documentation of interest. For example, I can find all variables related to “weapons” with a search.\r\n\r\nIdentifying labelled features\r\nStandard data consists of variables (e.g., country) and values (e.g. US, UK, CA). When working with labelled data, variables and values each have two features. Variables consist of a name and a label; values consist of a code and a label. For example, here are the features of the q8 variable.\r\nFeature\r\nAssignment\r\nVariable name\r\nq8\r\nVariable label\r\nSeat belt use\r\nValue codes\r\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5\r\nValue labels\r\nNever, Rarely, Sometimes, Most of the time, Always\r\nYou can see this information in the data dictionary - here is a snippet of the dictionary for three variables. The value_labels field combines the value codes and value labels.\r\n\r\n\r\ndictionary %>% \r\n  dplyr::filter(variable %in% c(\"q8\", \"q11\", \"q12\")) %>% \r\n  dplyr::select(variable, label, value_labels) %>% \r\n  knitr::kable() \r\n\r\n\r\nvariable\r\nlabel\r\nvalue_labels\r\nq8\r\nSeat belt use\r\n[1] Never; [2] Rarely; [3] Sometimes; [4] Most of the time; [5] Always\r\nq11\r\nTexting and driving\r\n[1] Did not drive; [2] 0 days; [3] 1 or 2 days; [4] 3 to 5 days; [5] 6 to 9 days; [6] 10 to 19 days; [7] 20 to 29 days; [8] All 30 days\r\nq12\r\nWeapon carrying\r\n[1] 0 days; [2] 1 day; [3] 2 or 3 days; [4] 4 or 5 days; [5] 6 or more days\r\n\r\nTo dive a bit deeper, you can see the class of the q8 variable:\r\n\r\n\r\ndat_raw %>% \r\n  dplyr::pull(q8) %>% \r\n  class(.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"haven_labelled\" \"vctrs_vctr\"     \"double\"        \r\n\r\nand how the metadata of q8 is stored.\r\n\r\n\r\ndat_raw %>% \r\n  dplyr::select(q8) %>% \r\n  str(.)\r\n\r\n\r\ntibble [203,663 x 1] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\r\n $ q8: dbl+lbl [1:203663]  2, NA,  4,  4,  1,  1,  3,  5,  4,  4,  ...\r\n   ..@ label        : chr \"Seat belt use\"\r\n   ..@ format.spss  : chr \"F1.0\"\r\n   ..@ display_width: int 4\r\n   ..@ labels       : Named num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\r\n   .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:5] \"Never\" \"Rarely\" \"Sometimes\" \"Most of the time\" ...\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to get into the weeds of this to work effectively with labelled data, but knowing this can help troubleshoot errors.\r\nViewing labelled features\r\nBeyond the dictionary, labelled features can also be seen when working with your data interactively. The console simultaneously prints value codes and labels side by side, with the code first followed by the label in brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\ndat_raw %>% \r\n  dplyr::select(q8, q11, q12) \r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 203,663 x 3\r\n                      q8       q11                 q12\r\n               <dbl+lbl> <dbl+lbl>           <dbl+lbl>\r\n 1  2 [Rarely]                  NA  4 [4 or 5 days]   \r\n 2 NA                           NA NA                 \r\n 3  4 [Most of the time]        NA  3 [2 or 3 days]   \r\n 4  4 [Most of the time]        NA  5 [6 or more days]\r\n 5  1 [Never]                   NA  5 [6 or more days]\r\n 6  1 [Never]                   NA  1 [0 days]        \r\n 7  3 [Sometimes]               NA  2 [1 day]         \r\n 8  5 [Always]                  NA  1 [0 days]        \r\n 9  4 [Most of the time]        NA  5 [6 or more days]\r\n10  4 [Most of the time]        NA NA                 \r\n# ... with 203,653 more rows\r\n\r\nSometimes the alignment throws me a bit when I am reading this as the value codes and labels are left aligned, which places the value codes associated with q12 closer to q11.\r\nWhen viewing the data frame in RStudio, the data frame displays the variable label under the variable name; however, only value codes (and not value labels) are displayed.\r\n\r\nCommon operations\r\nI primarily use three packages for working with labelled data: haven, labelled, and sjlabelled. These three packages do have some overlap in functionality, in addition to naming schemes that differ but achieve the same objective (e.g., haven::as_factor vs sjlabelled::as_label), or naming schemes that are the same but achieve different objectives (e.g., haven::as_factor vs sjlabelled::as_factor). 😬 To compound confusion, the concept of a label can refer to either variable or value labels. Frequently, plural function names refer to value labels, as in haven::zap_labels or labelled::remove_val_labels.\r\nHere are operations I commonly perform on labelled data:\r\nEvaluate if variable is of class haven_labelled.\r\nWhy? Troubleshooting, exploring, mutating.\r\nFunction(s): haven::is.labelled()\r\n\r\nConvert haven_labelled variable to numeric value codes.\r\nWhy? To treat the variable as continuous for analysis. For example, if a 1-7 rating scale imports as labelled and you want to compute a mean.\r\nFunction(s): base::as.numeric() (strips variable of all metadata), haven::zap_labels() and labelled::remove_val_labels (removes value labels, retains other metadata)\r\n\r\nConvert haven_labelled() variable to factor with value labels.\r\nWhy? To treat the variable as categorical for analysis.\r\nFunction(s): haven::as_factor(), labelled::to_factor(), sjlabelled::as_label(). As far as I can tell, these three functions have the same result. By default, the factor levels are ordered by value codes.\r\n\r\nConvert variable label to variable name.\r\nWhy? For more informative or readable variable names.\r\nFunction(s): sjlabelled::label_to_colnames()\r\n\r\nExample\r\nFor this example, I reduce the data set to 2017 records only and select three variables related to carrying weapons and safety, all of which are measured on the same scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n# retain info on weapons and safety for 2017 ----\r\ndat_2017 <- dat_raw %>% \r\n  dplyr::filter(year == 2017) %>% \r\n  dplyr::select(record, q12, q13, q15) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# preview data ----\r\ndat_2017\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 14,765 x 4\r\n    record                q12        q13                q15\r\n     <dbl>          <dbl+lbl>  <dbl+lbl>          <dbl+lbl>\r\n 1 1509749 5 [6 or more days] 1 [0 days] 1 [0 days]        \r\n 2 1509750 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 1 [0 days]        \r\n 3 1509751 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 3 [2 or 3 days]   \r\n 4 1509752 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 1 [0 days]        \r\n 5 1509753 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 1 [0 days]        \r\n 6 1509754 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 2 [1 day]         \r\n 7 1509755 5 [6 or more days] 1 [0 days] 5 [6 or more days]\r\n 8 1509756 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 1 [0 days]        \r\n 9 1509757 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 1 [0 days]        \r\n10 1509758 1 [0 days]         1 [0 days] 1 [0 days]        \r\n# ... with 14,755 more rows\r\n\r\nThis code produces a bar plot showing the frequencies of the three variables from data as imported, displaying variable names and value codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n# bar plot 1 ----\r\ndat_2017 %>% \r\n   pivot_longer(\r\n    cols = -1,\r\n    names_to = \"variable\",\r\n    values_to = \"days\"\r\n  ) %>% \r\n  count(variable, days) %>% \r\n  # include factor(days) to correctly show value codes in ggplot ----\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = factor(days))) +\r\n  facet_wrap(. ~ variable) +\r\n  geom_col() \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Bar plot 1 displays variable names and value codes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I add two lines of code to implement two changes - convert the variables to factors and convert the variable labels to variable names. This plot displays variable labels and value labels, producing a more informative figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n# bar plot 2 ----\r\ndat_2017 %>% \r\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  # change 1: convert haven_labelled variables to factors ----\r\n  mutate_if(haven::is.labelled, haven::as_factor) %>% \r\n  # change 2: convert variable labels to variable names ----\r\n  sjlabelled::label_to_colnames() %>% \r\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  pivot_longer(\r\n    cols = -1,\r\n    names_to = \"variable\",\r\n    values_to = \"days\"\r\n  ) %>% \r\n  count(variable, days) %>% \r\n  # unnecessary to include factor(days) here ----\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = days)) +\r\n  facet_wrap(. ~ variable) +\r\n  geom_col() \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Bar plot 2 displays variable labels and value labels\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther packages and haven_labelled objects\r\nIt is probably safe to assume that most packages you work with don’t know how to handle the haven_labelled class - if the package does produce a result, it is likely making an educated guess which may not be in line with your needs.\r\nFor example, in using ggplot for Figure 1 above, I included the line y = factor(days); if instead I had y = days in Figure 1, ggplot yields the following message:\r\n\r\nDon’t know how to automatically pick scale for object of type haven_labelled/vctrs_vctr/double. Defaulting to continuous.\r\n\r\nTreating the days variable as continuous resulted in an uninformative plot (not shown), which was corrected by converting the variable to factor.\r\nWhat about other packages I use? In skimr 2.1.2 haven_labelled inputs result in value codes treated as character values, and in gtsummary 1.3.5 haven_labelled inputs are omitted from output as it is not an accepted class. In general, you will probably find a mix of messages, warnings, errors, omissions, or guessing when using haven_labelled variables with other packages. These issues can be resolved by converting the haven_labelled variables to numeric or factor, depending on the context.\r\n\r\nNote added Feb 20, 2021: Although gtsummary does not currently support value labels, it does support variable labels! See this tweet for a quick demo.\r\nWorkflow for labelled data manipulation\r\nWhen converting haven_labelled objects to factor or numeric, be intentional about where the conversion happens in your workflow. The Introduction to labelled vignette by Joseph Larmarange outlines two different approaches:\r\nFirst convert haven_labelled variables; second perform data manipulation utilizing variable labels (if factor).\r\nFirst perform data manipulation utilizing variable codes; second convert haven_labelled variables.\r\nFor me this question usually distills down to: for data manipulation, are the value codes or the value labels easier to work with? Sometimes the brevity of the value code helps (i.e., q12 == 1), whereas other times the context of the value label makes the code more readable (i.e., q12 == \"0 days\"). Note that the placement of the conversion can have downstream effects on your code.\r\nSummary\r\nThe haven, labelled, sjlabelled packages create new structures and work flows for labelled data that allow you to harness the power of R while still honoring the valuable metadata framework that exists in SPSS, SAS, and Stata data sets. The functions discussed in this post cover most of my daily needs with labelled data; if you want to do more, next steps might include handling specific types of coded missing data or creating labelled data within R.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nThumbnail artwork was adapted from @allison_horst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We demonstrate how leveraging the devtools and usethis packages in package development can automate folder structure and file creation, speeding up the development process.\r\n\r\nThis post was updated on Nov 21, 2020 with the YouTube workshop recording. Some Q&A from the workshop are here.\r\nAbstract\r\nThis workshop is for people looking to learn how to make their own R packages and learn how to use usethis and devtools for package development. The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., usethis::create_package) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., devtools::document). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.\r\nThis workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.\r\nDisclaimer\r\n\r\n\r\nArtwork adapted from @allison_horst.\r\nI have learned enough about package development to share with you what has worked well for me; however, I am still learning! Comments and suggestions are welcome.\r\nGetting started\r\nThis material was developed using:\r\nSoftware / package\r\nVersion\r\nR\r\n4.0.3\r\nRStudio\r\n1.3.1073\r\ndevtools\r\n2.3.2\r\nusethis\r\n1.6.3\r\ntidyverse\r\n1.3.0\r\nrlang\r\n0.4.8\r\nbroom\r\n0.7.1\r\nPlease install and update all software / packages prior to following along, as otherwise errors may arise.\r\nTool kit\r\nSingle usage functions only need to be used one time in the development process; multiple usage functions are executed as needed. This table only contains functions used in this workshop; there are many other handy functions in devtools and usethis for package development.\r\nUsage\r\nFunction\r\nPurpose\r\nSingle\r\nusethis::create_package(\"path/package\")\r\ninitialize package\r\n\r\nusethis::use_mit_license(\"Your name\")\r\nadd license\r\n\r\nusethis::use_pipe()\r\nadd pipe function as a dependency\r\nMultiple\r\ndevtools::check()\r\nbuild package locally and check\r\n\r\ndevtools::load_all()\r\nload functions in 📂 R/ into memory\r\n\r\nusethis::use_r(\"function\")\r\ncreate R script for function\r\n\r\nusethis::use_package(\"package\")\r\nadd package dependency\r\n\r\ndevtools::document()\r\nbuild and add documentation\r\nOther resources:\r\nPackage development cheat sheet\r\nR packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan\r\nHow to develop good R packages by Maëlle Salmon\r\nR Package Primer by Karl Broman\r\nFirst package\r\nOpen an R session and submit the following, modified to your desired location. Here, I am creating a package named ralph on my desktop. (This name is inspired by R-Ladies Philly.)\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::create_package(\"C:/Users/Shannon.Pileggi/Desktop/ralph\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you have a package! The usethis::create_package function:\r\nCreates a new R project named ralph at your specified location.\r\nOpens the ralph project in a new RStudio session.\r\nCreates the minimal essential files and structure required for R packages.\r\n\r\nSee the package development cheat sheet for a picture overview of the full file structure.\r\nOptional:\r\nIf you are already authenticated, the usethis package has some handy functions to quickly connect your local package to a GitHub repository,\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::use_git()     # step 1 ----\r\nusethis::use_github()  # step 2 ----\r\n\r\n\r\nGitHub is renaming the default branch from master to main. Currently, usethis::use_github() creates a repo with the default branch named master.\r\nFor more references on using git / GitHub, see Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and GitHub for the useR or Ch 18 in R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.\r\nFirst check\r\nNow that we have a package, let’s check it. Submitting devtools::check() updates package documentation, builds the package, and submits over 50 checks for metadata, structure, R code, documentation, and more!\r\n\r\n\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n\r\nThis can take a while to run, depending on how big your package is. It is helpful to run frequently, especially if you are planning on submitting to CRAN. But even for internal packages, it is still good practice.\r\nOur first check results in a single warning - that our package needs a license in the DESCRIPTION file:\r\n\r\nTo fix this, add the license of your choice. A standard recommendation is the MIT license due to broad permissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::use_mit_license(\"Shannon Pileggi\")\r\n\r\nThis updates the description file, as well as creates two new license files in your project that you never have to touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION file automatically populates with some fields from your .Rprofile, which can be modified with usethis::edit_r_profile().\r\nYou can go back and complete the remaining description fields later. Re-submit\r\n\r\n\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n\r\nand our package is error, warning, and note free.\r\n\r\nFirst function\r\nCreate\r\nThe compute_corr function is a wrapper for cor.test that produces tidy output for Pearson’s correlation estimate (along with a p-value) to quantify the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.\r\n\r\n\r\ncompute_corr <- function(data, var1, var2){\r\n  \r\n    # compute correlation ----\r\n    cor.test(\r\n      x = data %>% dplyr::pull({{var1}}),\r\n      y = data %>% dplyr::pull({{var2}})\r\n    ) %>% \r\n    # tidy up results ----\r\n    broom::tidy() %>% \r\n    # retain and rename relevant bits ----\r\n    dplyr::select(\r\n      correlation = estimate, \r\n      pval = p.value\r\n    )\r\n  \r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis function uses tidy evaluation by embracing ({{) unquoted variable names.\r\nLet’s add the compute_corr function to ralph.\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::use_r(\"compute_corr\")\r\n\r\nThis creates a blank R script named compute_corr.R located in the R/ folder. It is convention that your function name and R script name are the same. Copy and paste the function to the blank R script, and then save.\r\n\r\nExecute\r\nTake your function for a test drive with devtools::load_all (“arguably the most important part of the devtools workflow”).\r\n\r\n\r\ndevtools::load_all()\r\n\r\nThis places your function in local memory so that you may tinker and confirm its execution. Let’s give it a try.\r\n\r\n\r\ncompute_corr(data = faithful, var1 = eruptions, var2 = waiting)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 2\r\n  correlation      pval\r\n        <dbl>     <dbl>\r\n1       0.901 8.13e-100\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on which packages are loaded in your R session, you may have a small hiccup here, which we discuss in the workshop.\r\nDocument\r\nNext document the compute_corr function using the Roxygen skeleton. First, place your cursor in the function definition, and then you can add the skeleton two ways:\r\nCode -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton, or\r\nCntrl + Alt + Shift + R\r\nYou should see this:\r\n\r\nwhere we now have an outline to fill in. Note that the three arguments in our function (data, var1, var2) were automatically detected. Update the documentation as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n#' Computes a tidy correlation\r\n#'\r\n#' @param data input data set\r\n#' @param var1 name of variable 1 \r\n#' @param var2 name of variable 2 \r\n#'\r\n#' @return A tibble with the Pearson correlation and the p-value\r\n#' @export\r\n#'\r\n#' @examples\r\n#' compute_corr(data = faithful, var1 = eruptions, var2 = waiting)\r\n\r\nSave your function and submit:\r\n\r\n\r\ndevtools::document()\r\n\r\nThis did a lot of work for you!\r\n\r\nThe man folder (short for manual) now contains a file called compute_corr.Rd. This is the documentation for your function; you never edit this manually.\r\nThe NAMESPACE now specifies that the package will export the compute_corr function.\r\nPreview the documentation with:\r\n\r\n\r\n?compute_corr\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to modify your documentation, make the changes in the Roxygen skeleton in compute_corr.R, save, and then resubmit devtools::document().\r\nCheck\r\nNow submit\r\n\r\n\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n\r\nand you’ll see that we have some concerns.\r\n\r\nThis is because compute_corr depends on functions from other packages, such as:\r\nThe pipe function (%>%) from the magrittr package.\r\nThe tidy function from the broom package.\r\nThe select function from the dplyr package.\r\nThe pull function from the dplyr package.\r\n\r\nAre any other functions missing from this list?\r\nDependencies\r\nWe can fix these errors, warnings, and notes by specifying the dependencies in the compute_corr function.\r\n1. Package dependencies\r\nTo specify a package dependency, the name of the package needs to be listed in the DESCRIPTION file. This can be automatically done for you by submitting\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::use_package(\"broom\")\r\nusethis::use_package(\"dplyr\")\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Functions within packages\r\nThere are three ways you can specify required functions within packages.\r\nUse the :: notation within your function, as in broom::tidy (recommended, used in this post).\r\nIn the Roxygen section of your function, use @importFrom pkg fun1 fun2 - if you prefer this over using ::.\r\nIn the Roxygen section of your function, @import pkg - imports all functions from a package; use sparingly/wisely as this makes your package bulkier.\r\nSpecial case\r\nThe pipe function (%>%) from the magrittr package is a special case. The easiest way to include the pipe is\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::use_pipe()  # step 1 ----\r\ndevtools::document() # step 2 ----\r\n\r\nHere, step 1 creates utils-pipe.R in your R folder and adds magrittr to imports in the DESCRIPTION file; step 2 adds the pipe to your NAMESPACE file.\r\n\r\nNow let’s run the check again:\r\n\r\n\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n\r\nCan you diagnose the note(s) this time? What steps would you take to correct it? I’m saving this for discussion in the workshop.1\r\n\r\nInstalling your package\r\nOpen a new R session. Install your package from your local directory or GitHub, load your package, and execute your functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n# install package from local directory ----\r\ndevtools::install(\"C:/Users/Shannon.Pileggi/Desktop/ralph\")\r\n\r\n# or install package from GitHub ----\r\n# devtools::install_github(\"shannonpileggi/ralph\")\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to GitHub renaming the default branch from master to main, you may need to fiddle with the ref argument in devtools::install_github.\r\n\r\n\r\n# load package ----\r\nlibrary(ralph)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# execute function ----\r\ncompute_corr(data = faithful, var1 = eruptions, var2 = waiting)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 2\r\n  correlation      pval\r\n        <dbl>     <dbl>\r\n1       0.901 8.13e-100\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nI hope you feel empowered to start developing your own packages now! We went through many of these steps one time only; however, in the development process, some of these steps are iterative. Here is a recap of our steps, although your work flow may differ.\r\nStep\r\nHow\r\n1. Load development packages.\r\nlibrary(usethis), library(devtools)\r\n2. Create new package.\r\nusethis::create_package(\"path/package\")\r\n3. Optional: Connect to GitHub repo.\r\nusethis::use_git(), usethis::use_github()\r\n4. Check build.\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n5. Add license.\r\nusethis::use_mit_license(\"Your name\")\r\n6. Check build.\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n7. Create new function.\r\nusethis::use_r(\"function\")\r\n8. Test drive function.\r\ndevtools::load_all()\r\n9. Insert Roxygen skeleton.\r\nMenu -> Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton\r\n10. Document package.\r\ndevtools::document()\r\n11. Preview documentation.\r\n?function\r\n12. Check build.\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n13. Specify package dependencies.\r\nusethis::use_package(\"package\")\r\n14. Specify functions within packages.\r\npackage::function\r\n15. Document package.\r\ndevtools::document()\r\n16. Check build.\r\ndevtools::check()\r\n17. Install package.\r\ndevtools::install(\"path/package\"), or\r\n\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"user/repo\")\r\n\r\nAlthough not explicitly written in these steps, I also recommend restarting R frequently in the development process (Session -> Restart R or Ctrl + Shift + F10) in order to test your package in a clean environment.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nThank you R-Ladies Philly for hosting this workshop! Chun Su kindly created the thumbnail image for this workshop, as well as provided feedback on this post and the workshop content (thank you for so generously sharing your time!). On R-Ladies slack, Mayra Valdés exchanged some ideas with me regarding different ways to write the compute_corr function and Jenny Bryan helped me better understand where {{ lives and how it works. I learned much of this content from attending the rstudio::conf2020 Building Tidy Tools workshop co-instructed by Charlotte Wickham and Hadley Wickham. Shout out to Hillary Parker for showing us all how to build packages from scratch in 2014.\r\nIn the compute_corr function we failed to specify that the cor.test function is from the stats package (which is loaded by default on start up). Update the compute_corr function with stats::cor.test, and then devtools::check() again. The notes regarding no visible binding… remain; solve with the .data pronoun. (1) Add rlang to your DESCRIPTION file with usethis::use_package(\"rlang\"). (2) Include #' @importFrom rlang .data in the Roxygen section of your function documentation. (3) In the compute_corr function, replace estimate with .data$estimate and p.value with .data$p.value. Here is the link to the error, warning, and note free ralph package on github.↩︎\r\n",

Skip to creating a single PowerPoint slide or to efficiently exporting multiple PowerPoint graphics with purrr.\r\nWhat is an editable PowerPoint graphic?\r\nAn editable PowerPoint graphic that is created within PowerPoint consists of two sets of editable components:\r\nVarious features of the graphic are editable, including items like size, color, and font (see Gif 1).\r\nThe data behind the graphic are editable (see Gif 2). This means that you can open the table linked to the chart and manually edit it in order to alter the data displayed in the graphic.\r\nAn editable PowerPoint graphic constructed in R through the officer + rvg functions described here produce vector graphics (i.e., shapes). This permits editing various features of the graphic (e.g., color, size), but not the data behind it (no linked table is created).\r\nWhy should I create it?\r\nIn my line of work, the primary deliverable is a PowerPoint slide deck. When creating an R graphic for a slide deck, I could export the graphic as an image (like a .png) to be inserted into PowerPoint, or I can export the graphic directly to an editable PowerPoint slide. Both of these options have pros and cons.\r\nFeature\r\nPowerPoint editable graphic\r\nImage (e.g., .png)\r\nEditability\r\n👍\r\n👎\r\nResizing\r\n👎\r\n👍\r\nData table\r\n👎\r\n👎\r\nThe editable PowerPoint graphic allows for direct editing in PowerPoint, but re-sizes poorly when done manually within PowerPoint. A .png image does not allow for direct editing within PowerPoint, but does nicely retain image ratios when re-sizing. Lastly, neither method produces a linked data table behind the graphic for editing.\r\nHow do I create it?\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(here)\r\nlibrary(glue)\r\nlibrary(officer)\r\nlibrary(rvg)\r\nlibrary(viridis)\r\n\r\nFirst, let’s create a quick graphic for demonstration purposes using ggplot2::diamonds. We subset the data on specific values of color and clarity and produce a scatter plot showing the relationship between price and carat.\r\n\r\n\r\np <- diamonds %>% \r\n  filter(color == \"D\" & clarity == \"I1\") %>% \r\n  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +\r\n    geom_point() +\r\n    theme_minimal() +\r\n    ggtitle(\"Color: D; Clarity: I1\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to export this graphic to an editable PowerPoint slide, first use the rvg package to convert the object to class dml (required to make graphic editable).\r\n\r\n\r\np_dml <- rvg::dml(ggobj = p)\r\n\r\nThen export the dml object to a PowerPoint slide with officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n# initialize PowerPoint slide ----\r\nofficer::read_pptx() %>%\r\n  # add slide ----\r\n  officer::add_slide() %>%\r\n  # specify object and location of object ----\r\n  officer::ph_with(p_dml, ph_location()) %>%\r\n  # export slide -----\r\n  base::print(\r\n    target = here::here(\r\n      \"_posts\",\r\n      \"2020-09-22-exporting-editable-ggplot-graphics-to-powerpoint-with-officer-and-purrr\",\r\n      \"slides\",\r\n      \"demo_one.pptx\"\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n\r\nHere is a screen shot of the resulting PowerPoint slide, or you can download demo_one.pptx.\r\n\r\nWhen should I do this more efficiently?\r\nThere are 56 combinations of color and clarity in the diamonds data set; naturally, your colleague wants all 56 plots (at least for the appendix of the report 😂). So we definitely want an efficient way to do this!\r\nAutomate many plots\r\nThis work follows up on blog posts by Laurens Geffert, Len Kiefer, and Bruno Rodrigues, which were fantastic resources to help me get started. The officer package enacted changes in version 0.3.11(?) which necessitate updates to these methods (see Acknowledgements). In addition, Amber Thomas outlined a purrr work flow that resonates with me.\r\nI start with a table outlining the 56 combinations of color and clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n# tibble of all possible combinations ----\r\ndiamonds_grid <- diamonds %>% \r\n  count(color, clarity) %>% \r\n  # for mapping, we need input values to be character ----\r\n  mutate_all(as.character)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# view values of grid ----\r\ndiamonds_grid\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 56 x 3\r\n   color clarity n    \r\n   <chr> <chr>   <chr>\r\n 1 D     I1      42   \r\n 2 D     SI2     1370 \r\n 3 D     SI1     2083 \r\n 4 D     VS2     1697 \r\n 5 D     VS1     705  \r\n 6 D     VVS2    553  \r\n 7 D     VVS1    252  \r\n 8 D     IF      73   \r\n 9 E     I1      102  \r\n10 E     SI2     1713 \r\n# ... with 46 more rows\r\n\r\nThen I create a function that produces the plot for any given combination of color and clarity. As ggplot produces plots for the available data, there are some additional updates to this function to maintain consistency across all plots. We use a named color vector to create consistency in plotting colors across all plots, in addition to enforcing consistency in the x and y plotting ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n# named vector for the colors assigned to cut ----\r\n# values are the colors assigned ----\r\ncolor_cut <- viridis::viridis(5) %>% \r\n  # assign levels of cut as names to colors ----\r\n  rlang::set_names(levels(diamonds[[\"cut\"]]))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# view named color vector ----\r\ncolor_cut\r\n\r\n       Fair        Good   Very Good     Premium       Ideal \r\n\"#440154FF\" \"#3B528BFF\" \"#21908CFF\" \"#5DC863FF\" \"#FDE725FF\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# function to produce scatter plot of carat and price for given values of color and clarity ----\r\nplot_diamonds <- function(this_color, this_clarity){\r\n  diamonds %>% \r\n    filter(color == this_color & clarity == this_clarity) %>% \r\n    ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +\r\n      geom_point() +\r\n      theme_minimal() +\r\n      # maintain consistent plot ranges ----\r\n      xlim(range(diamonds[[\"carat\"]])) +\r\n      ylim(range(diamonds[[\"price\"]])) +\r\n      # maintain consistent colors for cut ----\r\n      # show all values of cut in legend, regardless if appear in this plot ----\r\n      scale_color_manual(values = color_cut, drop = F) +\r\n      # title indicates which combination is plotted ----\r\n      ggtitle(glue::glue(\"Color: {this_color}; Clarity: {this_clarity}\")) \r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nNext I utilize the plot_diamonds function with purrr to create a list with 56 ggplot objects representing all combinations of color and clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\ndiamonds_gg <- purrr::map2(\r\n  # first argument to plot_diamonds function ----\r\n  diamonds_grid[[\"color\"]],\r\n  # second argument to plot_diamonds function ----\r\n  diamonds_grid[[\"clarity\"]],\r\n  # function to map ----\r\n  plot_diamonds\r\n)\r\n\r\nExport many plots\r\nTo export these, I use two helper functions. The first function, create_dml, converts the ggplot objects to dml objects.\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate_dml <- function(plot){\r\n  rvg::dml(ggobj = plot)\r\n}\r\n\r\nApply this function to the list of ggplot objects to create a list of dml objects with the same dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\ndiamonds_dml <- purrr::map(diamonds_gg, create_dml)\r\n\r\nThe second function automates exporting all slides to PowerPoint, with some additional options to specify the position and size (inches) of the graphic. The default size (9in x 4.95in) produces a graphic that fills a standard sized slide.\r\n\r\n\r\n# function to export plot to PowerPoint ----\r\ncreate_pptx <- function(plot, path, left = 0.5, top = 1, width = 9, height = 4.95){\r\n  \r\n    # if file does not yet exist, create new PowerPoint ----\r\n    if (!file.exists(path)) {\r\n        out <- officer::read_pptx()\r\n    }\r\n    # if file exist, append slides to exisiting file ----\r\n    else {\r\n        out <- officer::read_pptx(path)\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    out %>% \r\n      officer::add_slide() %>% \r\n      officer::ph_with(plot, location = officer::ph_location(\r\n        width = width, height = height, left = left, top = top)) %>% \r\n      base::print(target = path)\r\n}\r\n\r\nNote that this function opens and closes PowerPoint for each slide created, so more slides will take longer to export. This particular set of graphics took ~6 minutes to export due to the number of slides and the number of points on some slides 😬 (which is longer than usual for my typical applications).\r\n\r\n\r\npurrr::map(\r\n  # dml plots to export ----\r\n  diamonds_dml, \r\n  # exporting function ----\r\n  create_pptx, \r\n  # additional fixed arguments in create_pptx ----\r\n  path = here::here(\r\n    \"_posts\", \r\n    \"2020-09-22-exporting-editable-ggplot-graphics-to-powerpoint-with-officer-and-purrr\",\r\n    \"slides\", \r\n    \"demo_many.pptx\"\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n\r\nHere is a screen shot of the resulting PowerPoint slide, or you can download demo_many.pptx.\r\n\r\nWho should do the editing?\r\nNow that you have editable PowerPoint slides, you have two parties capable of editing the graphics: (1) the R developer, and (2) the collaborator.\r\nThe R developer should do further slide editing when:\r\nedits are universal (i.e., reduce size of all plots to 6in x 3in).\r\nedits are data driven (i.e., represent all points where carat exceeds a value of 3 as a star)\r\nThe collaborator should do further slide editing when:\r\nedits are bespoke (i.e. Bob wants to see slide 25 in bold for the marketing team)\r\nedits are beyond the budget (i.e., super custom axis adornment)\r\nLimitations\r\nWhile the graphics exported to PowerPoint from R are editable, they do have limitations compared to graphics created within PowerPoint.\r\nAs previously mentioned, there is no linked data table behind the graphics, which can be unnerving for a colleague who wants to quality check the figure (I often export labeled and unlabeled versions of figures for this).\r\nThe points are not naturally grouped features as they would be for graphics created within PowerPoint. This means that if your colleagues wants to change the shade of yellow for the ideal cut diamonds they would have to click on each and every single yellow point in all slides (see Gif 3 for preview of what the slide looks like when you click around).\r\nSummary\r\nEditable PowerPoint ggplot graphics created through officer + rvg + purrr can be a great way to provide your colleague with fantastic graphics while still allowing them to refine the graphics with their own finishing touches. Do expect a lot of iteration on the graphic to get it as close as possible to their needs before you hit that final send on the PowerPoint deck.\r\nAppendix\r\nGif 1\r\nDemonstration of editable features in graphic created within PowerPoint.

A presentation allows the candidate to highlight their strengths, and, after being a college professor for six years, I was confident in my public speaking. The specific presentation instructions were:\r\n\r\nThis can be any 20 minute presentation you’d like to share with the team; our recommendation is that it focuses on Market Research, is something innovative, and something that you’re particularly proud of!\r\n\r\nIt was also briefly mentioned in the phone screening that the analytics group with whom I was interviewing was just beginning to develop shiny applications.\r\nFormulation\r\nThen I faced the dilemma of what to actually present. I wanted to shine as a candidate, but my previous academic experience was tangential to this industry. I took their instructions to heart and decided to create something of which I was truly proud. I developed a project with three goals in mind:\r\nLearn about my prospective employer.\r\nCultivate my nascent tidyverse skills.\r\nInvest in new analytic methods and coding techniques that could serve future me.\r\nFrom there, I had to figure out what I would actually present.\r\nFortuitous tweets\r\nThis was winter 2018, which also happened to be the inaugural year of #tidytuesday. Prompted by David Robinson’s screencast analyzing medium articles with tidytext, I was inspired to apply the same principles of text analysis to my prospective employer’s twitter account.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this week's #tidytuesday screencast, I use tidytext to analyze what titles get claps on Medium posts. Practical guides on tensorflow/keras are the hottest, words like “marketing”, “trends” and “industry” don't get you far https://t.co/oNhZm40mpW #rstats pic.twitter.com/cxYO2MIIqz\r\n\r\n— David Robinson (@drob) December 4, 2018\r\n\r\nAs I started to create my presentation, I was also concerned with the actual format / deliverable for the presentation. I knew I wanted to create something in R, but I was not quite sure which direction to go. I tweeted an #rstats plea for advice and was inspired by Emily Riederer’s suggestion to use a flexdashboard for the presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re having trouble with xaringan, storyboards in flexdashboqrd can also make pretty nice presentations depending on the type of content / message you are trying to convey https://t.co/IC3moe01v0\r\n\r\n— Emily Riederer (@EmilyRiederer) December 12, 2018\r\n\r\nWhat I did\r\nAfter many hours at the computer, several re-watches of David Robinson’s screencast, and a lot of research on R functions and analytic methods, I created a presentation about my prospective employer based on trends in their twitter account between 2009 (account start date) and 2018 (interview date). Here are the packages that I used, alongside their purpose with links to code on github:\r\nrtweet: retrieve tweets from @AdelphiResearch.\r\ndplyr, forcats, lubridate, stringr, and purrr: create new variables with regards to tweet descriptors and hashtag themes; summarize trends in top hashtags over time\r\nggplot2: exploratory visualization of tweet frequency, trends in likes and re-tweets per tweet, and trends in hashtag themes over time\r\ntidytext: transform tweet words to analyzable tokens; prepare words for modeling\r\nwidyr, igraph, ggraph: network analysis of common hashtag themes and tweet text\r\nglmnet: lasso model to assess word associations with likes and retweets\r\nshiny: develop shiny apps to search tweets and explore the network analyses\r\nflexdashboard: assemble it all in a presentation\r\nYes, it was a lot! Especially because the tidyverse, pulling tweets, text analysis, network analysis, lasso models, flexdashboards, and shiny apps were all very new to me.\r\nResults\r\nI hosted my presentation and the two shiny applications on shinyapps.io, and I made my code publicly available on github.\r\nLink \r\nPreview \r\nInterview presentation\r\n\r\nShiny app for tweet look up\r\n\r\nShiny app for network analysis\r\n\r\nCode on github\r\n\r\nIn the end, I got the job! Along the way, I gleaned insights about the values and industry of my prospective employer, empowering me throughout the interview process. Additionally, my interviewers enjoyed the external data-driven view of their company’s tweets (despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that none of them were actually on twitter).\r\nI embraced the interview as an opportunity to create my own side project to foster new skills that would serve me for other potential interviews, personal projects, or work projects. Yes, I probably could have secured a job offer with less effort, but I would have been less confident and I would have missed out on so many data and programming approaches that are now ingrained in my thought processes. And enabled by the #rstats twitter presence, the incredible packages that I used, and the numerous blog posts that I referenced, I had fun. Cheers, R! 🥂\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nThumbnail artwork by @allison_horst. Thanks to Megan McClintock (my sister) for feedback and suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To get started, let’s visually inspect a few values.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train %>% \r\n  select(Name) %>% \r\n  head(10)\r\n\r\n                                                  Name\r\n1                              Braund, Mr. Owen Harris\r\n2  Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer)\r\n3                               Heikkinen, Miss. Laina\r\n4         Futrelle, Mrs. Jacques Heath (Lily May Peel)\r\n5                             Allen, Mr. William Henry\r\n6                                     Moran, Mr. James\r\n7                              McCarthy, Mr. Timothy J\r\n8                       Palsson, Master. Gosta Leonard\r\n9    Johnson, Mrs. Oscar W (Elisabeth Vilhelmina Berg)\r\n10                 Nasser, Mrs. Nicholas (Adele Achem)\r\n\r\nIn this brief print out, each passenger’s title is consistently located between , and .. Luckily, this holds true for all observations! With this consistency, we can somewhat easily extract a title from Name. Depending on your field, this operation may be referred to something along the lines of data preparation or feature engineering.\r\nTL; DR\r\nApproach\r\nFunction(s)\r\nRegular expression(s)\r\n1\r\nstr_locate + str_sub\r\n\",\" + \"\\\\.\"\r\n2\r\nstr_match\r\n\"(.*)(, )(.*)(\\\\.)(.*)\"\r\n3\r\nstr_extract + str_sub\r\n\"([A-z]+)\\\\.\"\r\n4\r\nstr_replace_all\r\n\"(.*, )|(\\\\..*)\"\r\nRead on for explanations!\r\nOverview of regular expressions\r\nRegular expressions can be used to parse character strings, which you can think of as a key to unlock string patterns. The trick is identify the right regular expression + function combination. Let’s demo four ways to tackle the challenge utilizing functions from the stringr package; each method specifies a different string pattern to match.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(stringr)\r\n\r\nExtracting title from name\r\nFirst approach\r\nICYMI, the double bracket in titanic_train[[\"Name\"]] is used to extract a named variable vector from a data frame, which has some benefits over the more commonly used dollar sign (i.e., titanic_train$Name). Now onward.\r\nThe str_locate function produces the starting and ending position of a specified pattern. If we consider the comma to be a pattern, we can figure out where it is located in each name. Here, the starting and ending value is the same because the comma is only one character.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_locate(\",\") %>%\r\n  head()\r\n\r\n     start end\r\n[1,]     7   7\r\n[2,]     8   8\r\n[3,]    10  10\r\n[4,]     9   9\r\n[5,]     6   6\r\n[6,]     6   6\r\n\r\nKnowing this, we can identify the positions of the comma and the period and then extract the text in between. Some notes here:\r\nBecause str_locate function returns a matrix, we use . as a placeholder in .[,1] to access the first column of values.\r\nBecause . is a special character in regular expressions, we use the double backslash in \"\\\\.\" to escape it.\r\n\r\n\r\ncomma_pos <- titanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_locate(\",\") %>% \r\n  .[,1]\r\n\r\nperiod_pos <- titanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_locate(\"\\\\.\") %>% \r\n  .[,1]\r\n\r\nNow we can use str_sub to extract substrings from the character vector based on their physical position. To exclude the punctuation and white space, we can add two to the comma position and subtract one from the period position to get the title only.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_sub(comma_pos + 2, period_pos - 1) %>% \r\n  head()\r\n\r\n[1] \"Mr\"   \"Mrs\"  \"Miss\" \"Mrs\"  \"Mr\"   \"Mr\"  \r\n\r\nSuper!\r\nSecond approach\r\nThe str_match function creates a character matrix for each group matched in the specified pattern. With the correct regular expression, str_match returns the complete match in addition to each matched group. Here’s a quick example:\r\n\r\n\r\n# ----------5 groups-->>>----1---2---3----4---5----                      \r\nstr_match(\"XXX, YYY. ZZZ\", \"(.*)(, )(.*)(\\\\.)(.*)\")\r\n\r\n     [,1]            [,2]  [,3] [,4]  [,5] [,6]  \r\n[1,] \"XXX, YYY. ZZZ\" \"XXX\" \", \" \"YYY\" \".\"  \" ZZZ\"\r\n\r\nLet’s break down this regular expression pattern.\r\nThe parentheses () indicate a grouping\r\nThe 2nd grouping (, ) only has one modification from the pattern used in the first example - here we include a space after the comma.\r\nThe 4th grouping (\\\\.) remains unchanged from the first example.\r\nin the 1st, 3rd, and 5th grouping (.*)\r\nThe period . means any character\r\nThe asterisk * means matches at least 0 times\r\n\r\nTo execute this, we’ll grab the 4th column to catch our title.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_match(\"(.*)(, )(.*)(\\\\.)(.*)\") %>%\r\n  .[,4] %>% \r\n  head()\r\n\r\n[1] \"Mr\"   \"Mrs\"  \"Miss\" \"Mrs\"  \"Mr\"   \"Mr\"  \r\n\r\nAll right, we got it again!\r\nThird approach\r\nLastly, let’s use the str_extract function to extract matching patterns. This seems like what we wanted to do all along!\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_extract(\"([A-z]+)\\\\.\") %>%\r\n  head()\r\n\r\n[1] \"Mr.\"   \"Mrs.\"  \"Miss.\" \"Mrs.\"  \"Mr.\"   \"Mr.\"  \r\n\r\nLet’s break down this regular expression:\r\nHere, the bracket []specifies a list of permitted characters.\r\nInside the bracket, we specify strings that consist of both upper and lower case letters with A-z.\r\nThe + outside the bracket signifies “match at least one time”, i.e., grab all the letters.\r\nFinally, ending in \\\\. indicates that our pattern should end in period.\r\nPutting it all together, this pattern translates to “grab all upper case and lower case letters immediately preceeding a period.”\r\nThis pattern is a bit more sophisticated to compose than the previous ones, but it gets right to the point! This last effort does end in a period, whereas the others do not. If we wanted to remove the period for consistency, we could use str_sub with the end argument to specify the position of the last character.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_extract(\"([A-z]+)\\\\.\") %>%\r\n  str_sub(end = -2) %>%\r\n  head()\r\n\r\n[1] \"Mr\"   \"Mrs\"  \"Miss\" \"Mrs\"  \"Mr\"   \"Mr\"  \r\n\r\nFourth approach\r\nAs a last approach, we can use str_replace_all to replace all matched patterns with null character values. Here, we specify the pattern and then the replacement string.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train[[\"Name\"]] %>% \r\n  str_replace_all(\"(.*, )|(\\\\..*)\", \"\") %>%\r\n  head()\r\n\r\n[1] \"Mr\"   \"Mrs\"  \"Miss\" \"Mrs\"  \"Mr\"   \"Mr\"  \r\n\r\nIn this regular expression,\r\nThere are two groupings separated by a vertical pipe | which means “or”.\r\nThe two groupings should look familar:\r\nThe first grouping looks for all characters preceeding a comma space.\r\nThe second grouping looks for all characters following a period.\r\n\r\nPutting it together, if grouping 1 or grouping 2 is satisifed then those character values are replaced with null character values.\r\nRe-classifying entries\r\nNow that we figured out how to extract the title, I’ll utilize the last method and assign title as a variable to the titanic_train data set using the mutate function.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train <- titanic_train %>%\r\n  mutate(title = str_replace_all(titanic_train[[\"Name\"]], \"(.*, )|(\\\\..*)\", \"\"))\r\n\r\nNow let’s use count to get a frequency table of the titles, with the sort = TRUE option to arrange the results in descending order.\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train %>%\r\n  count(title, sort = TRUE)\r\n\r\n          title   n\r\n1            Mr 517\r\n2          Miss 182\r\n3           Mrs 125\r\n4        Master  40\r\n5            Dr   7\r\n6           Rev   6\r\n7           Col   2\r\n8         Major   2\r\n9          Mlle   2\r\n10         Capt   1\r\n11          Don   1\r\n12     Jonkheer   1\r\n13         Lady   1\r\n14          Mme   1\r\n15           Ms   1\r\n16          Sir   1\r\n17 the Countess   1\r\n\r\nWe can see that there are several infrequent titles occuring only one or two times, and so we should re-classify them. If you want to squeeze the most juice out of your data, try to figure out the historical context and meaning of those titles to create a better classification for them. For now, let’s take the easy way out by just re-classifying them to an other group.\r\nFortunately, the forcats package has an awesome function that let’s us do this quickly: fct_lump. We’re using mutate again to re-classified title. The fct_lump function combines the least frequent values together in an other group, and the n = 6 option specifies to keep the 6 most common values (so the 7th value is other).\r\n\r\n\r\ntitanic_train %>%\r\n  mutate(title = fct_lump(title, n = 6)) %>%\r\n  count(title, sort = TRUE)\r\n\r\n   title   n\r\n1     Mr 517\r\n2   Miss 182\r\n3    Mrs 125\r\n4 Master  40\r\n5  Other  14\r\n6     Dr   7\r\n7    Rev   6\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to explicitly re-code the infrequent titles to something more meaningful than other, look into fct_recode.\r\nSuper, now title is ready to use for analysis!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nSo do I have piping hot data or am I piping hot data? Let’s break it down.\r\nPiping Hot Data\r\nWow, my data is piping hot! This connotes exciting, newly released data! I can’t promise that I’ll fulfill this expectation. Let’s just say that I’ll talk about data occasionally, and on special occassions it might even be piping hot.\r\nPiping Hot Data\r\nHere, I am piping my elusive hot data. This is what I was really going for - an ode to the pipe in R:\r\n\r\n%>%\r\n\r\nThe pipe operator simplifies long operations by linking multiple functions simultaneously. Although the coding construct of the pipe has been floating around since the 1970’s, the floodgates didn’t open for R until 2014. I don’t know the exact date, but I do remember the first time I saw those three characters and the sea of emotions that rained down. Confusion. Curiousity. Excitement.\r\nIn just 4 short years, the pipe and its friends in the tidyverse have revolutionized how we code in R, to the point that you may feel illiterate at conferences if you don’t have some baseline understanding - at first. Because the beauty of the pipe is that it streamlines readability of R code, such that even if you have never done it, you can still get the gist of what is going on. So much so that believers are proselytizing “Teach the tidyverse to beginners”!\r\nLet’s lay the pipelines with a quick example using the classic iris data set. To get started, load the tidyverse library and get an overview of the data.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nglimpse(iris)\r\n\r\nRows: 150\r\nColumns: 5\r\n$ Sepal.Length <dbl> 5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5.0, 5.4, 4.6, 5.0, 4.4,...\r\n$ Sepal.Width  <dbl> 3.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9, 3.4, 3.4, 2.9,...\r\n$ Petal.Length <dbl> 1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4,...\r\n$ Petal.Width  <dbl> 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2,...\r\n$ Species      <fct> setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, seto...\r\n\r\nOur simple objective is to compute the mean Sepal.Length for each Species in the data set and then arrange the results in descending order. There are many ways to accomplish this without the tidyverse, but for the sake of side-by-side comparisons I’ll demo this using tidyverse functions first without and then with piping.\r\n\r\n\r\narrange(\r\n  summarise(\r\n    group_by(iris, Species), \r\n    mean = mean(Sepal.Length)\r\n  ), \r\n  desc(mean)\r\n)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\r\n  Species     mean\r\n  <fct>      <dbl>\r\n1 virginica   6.59\r\n2 versicolor  5.94\r\n3 setosa      5.01\r\n\r\nWithout using pipes, we have to read our code inside to out to understand the operations executed. Our iris data set is buried in the middle of the code, and then the operations performed of group_by, summarise, and arrange spring outward from there (reading up from iris). Now let’s try the same manipulations utilizing piping.\r\n\r\n\r\niris %>% \r\n  group_by(Species) %>% \r\n  summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Length)) %>%\r\n  arrange(desc(mean))\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\r\n  Species     mean\r\n  <fct>      <dbl>\r\n1 virginica   6.59\r\n2 versicolor  5.94\r\n3 setosa      5.01\r\n\r\nVoilá! It’s clear from the left side of the pipe that all manipulations are done on the iris data set, and it’s clear from the right side of the pipe that the series of operations performed are group_by, summarise, and arrange. Wow, I like the way data flow through those pipes!\r\nWhile the name of this blog gives an nod to the powerful pipe, the pipe isn’t going to permeate every solution to programming challenges. So here is what to expect from Piping Hot Data:\r\nDemo data science tools and methods.\r\nDiscover new data and R packages.\r\nDeliberate data and technical topics.\r\nI hope you enjoy!\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nThumbnail artwork by @allison_horst.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

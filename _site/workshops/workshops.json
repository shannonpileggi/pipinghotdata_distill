We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or purrr::map_ (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.). Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the purrr::map_ family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We demonstrate handy functions in usethis and devtools, strategies for writing tests, debugging techniques, and broad concepts in function writing that facilitate a smoother testing process.\r\nThis workshop picks up exactly where we left our little ralph (aka R-Ladies Philly) package one year ago with “Your first R package in 1 hour: Tools that make R package development easy”. Participants will get the most out of this workshop if they review those materials in advance, or if they are already familiar with building R packages with devtools and usethis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., usethis::create_package) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., devtools::document). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.\r\nThis workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

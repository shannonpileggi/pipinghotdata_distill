## Is this course for me?

This course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to these questions:

-   Have you been using R for a while and feel there might be better ways to organize your R life, but don't know what they are?

-   Do you want to streamline your workflow for doing analysis and automating repetitive tasks in R?

-   Are you willing to get into the weeds of your R installation, project organization, error messages, and source code?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning objectives

### Project-oriented workflow 

-   Establish the concept of the project as the basic organizational unit of work.
    RStudio offers rich support for this way of working via **P**rojects.

-   Describe benefits of project oriented workflows.

-   Apply best practices for working in RStudio projects, including

    -   Creating robust file paths that travel well in time and space (someone else's computer, your computer a year from now) with base R and with the {here} and {fs} packages.

    -   Constructing human and machine readable file names that sort nicely.

    -   Differentiating workflow elements, analysis inputs, and analysis outputs in project structure to create navigable programming interfaces.

    -   Restarting R frequently, with a blank slate.

### Git/GitHub 

-   Employ version control via git and GitHub with operations including commit, push and pull.

-   Fork and clone from remote repositories.

-   Describe importance of viewing commits and diffs.

-   Compile markdown reports from an R script for sharing code products on GitHub.

-   Create a project web site via GitHub Pages.

-   Compare and execute different methods to re-visit previous versions of projects.

-   Utilize branches as safety nets for code experimentation.

-   Explain situations that can create merge conflicts and strategies to resolve them.

### Personal R Administration 

-   Identify where software, packages, and configuration files are located on your operating system via base R, {fs}, {usethis}, and {devtools} functions.

-   Explain the scope and purpose of `.Renviron` and `.Rprofile` configuration files when starting R.
    Modify these files for your personal needs and preferences.

-   Employ strategies for package management, including establishing where packages are installed, how to upgrade and downgrade, how to install from source, and actual package managers.

-   Locate and navigate R package source code for better understanding of internal operations or troubleshooting.

-   Identify what is in your current R session (packages, versions); briefly introduce {renv} to create a reproducible environment.

### Debugging 

-   Locate and view function source code.

-   Examine function source code to generate insights on errors.

-   Apply strategies to effectively search GitHub.

-   Distinguish between strategies for debugging your own code versus someone else's code.

-   Discuss debugging functions (`traceback()`, `browser()`, `debug()`, `trace()`, and `recover()`) and the additional benefits of employing some of these strategies within RStudio.

### Iterating well with purrr 

-   Describe drawbacks of copying and pasting R code.

-   Complete tidyverse style code with the pipe operator (`%>%` in {magrittr}, and the newer `|>` in base R).

-   Accomplish iteration through vectorized functions.

-   Leverage `group_by()` as an iterative technique.

-   Explain differences between base R and {purrr} iterative functions.

-   Explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes; explain how to extract elements from a list.

-   Apply functions from the `purrr::map_` family to perform iteration as an alternative to loops.

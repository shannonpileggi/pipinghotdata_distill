# Overview

In this workshop you will learn how to import messy data from an Excel
spreadsheet, and develop the R skills to turn this mess into tidy data
ready for analysis.

## Learning objectives

-   The acquire a foundational understanding of how data should be organized.

-   To import Excel files with (common, messy) data problems.

-   To address and clean common messy data problems in each variable.

-   To address and clean data with more complex meta-problems, like pivoting to long format for data analysis, thickening timestamped data to manageable time units, padding missing dates, and joining different datasets together.

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is
the right workshop for you.

-   Do you frequently receive untidy data for analysis in Excel
    spreadsheets?

-   Does this drive you slightly batty?

-   Do you want to learn how to make your life easier with a suite of
    data cleaning tools?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. It will be
assumed that participants can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%`/`|>` operator is a major plus,
but is not required.

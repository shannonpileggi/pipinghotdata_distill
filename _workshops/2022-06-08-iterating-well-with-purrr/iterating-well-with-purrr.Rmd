# Overview

A zoom workshop on iterating well with purrr for R-Ladies Rabat.

# Abstract

In this workshop we discuss approaches to iteration in R. We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or `purrr::map_` (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.). Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the `purrr::map_` family.

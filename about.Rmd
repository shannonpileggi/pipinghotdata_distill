## Professional


Iâ€™m an enthusiastic professional educator and statistical consultant with over ten years of experience collaborating on data analysis with diverse partners in industry, tech, public health, and clinical research.  My previous work experiences include supporting research on parasitic diseases at the CDC, contributing to curriculum development at the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University, and instructing advanced programming and modeling courses at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.  I am currently a Data Scientist at [The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium](http://pcctc.org/){target="_blank"}, housed under [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/){target="_blank"}, working remotely from my home in Doylestown, PA.    

## R-Ladies

I am on the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/){target="_blank"} leadership team and an [R-Ladies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/){target="_blank"} co-organizer. R-Ladies promotes gender diversity in the R community, and I highly recommend [getting involved](https://rladies.org/about-us/involved/){target="_blank"}. 


## Personal

I have two daughters, one of which is my alarm clock and the other is my midnight collaborator.  My [partner](https://www.stochastic-squirrel.com/){target="_blank"} is incredibly supportive and inspirational, and we exchange ideas on data and R programming.  I've won many coveted recreational soccer league _Champion_ t-shirts, and on the weekends we like to cruise around on our bikes.  On the rare occasions when both children are asleep and we aren't working or talking about data, you'll find us relaxing with adult beverages and board games.

# TL; DR

In August of 2023 I traveled to the University of Warwick in Coventry, England to
participate in the [R Project
Sprint](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/){target="_blank"}, where I worked collaboratively on contributions to base R alongside novice 
and experienced contributors, as well as the R Core Team. 

# About

The source code for base R is a mixture of R and C code. The bug fixes, maintenance, and
enhancement of this code base is upheld by volunteers. Those who make the 
executive decisions are the [R Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html){target="_blank"}; however, 
community members are still encouraged to contribute.

The aim of the R Project Sprint as I perceive it was to foster mentorship, collaborations,
and personal relationships between the novice and experienced contributors, reducing
the barrier to one's first contribution.

The purpose of this post is describe my personal experience at this event; a comprehensive 
guide for how contribute to base R is documented on the [R Contribution Working Group website](https://contributor.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}.

# Applying to participate

[Applications to participate](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/){target="_blank"} in the event were due in March 2023, and later that month I was notified of my acceptance. The expectations for participants' knowledge base coming into the event
was nicely outlined in the application.


# Prior to the event

Leading up to the event there was communication about optional things
we could do to prepare, most of which is available at the [R Contribution Working Group website](https://contributor.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}. This included:

* Joining the [R Contributors slack group](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack){target="_blank"}.

* Participating in [online events](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/){target="_blank"} such as a C book club for R Contributors and R Contributor office hours.

* Watching recorded [tutorials and demonstrations](https://contributor.r-project.org/tutorials/){target="_blank"}.

* Submitting [proposals](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/ideas-and-proposals.html){target="_blank"} for topics to tackle during the Sprint.


# Participants

The [R Project Sprint participants](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/participants/){target="_blank"} were impressively diverse both in terms
of professional experience and geographic residence. A non-exhaustive list of countries
represented at the in-person event includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, England, India, Hungary, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, and Senegal, Switzerland, and United States.

Some individuals participated remotely via video conference, either by choice
or circumstance. The combination of [the United Kingdom's air traffic
control issues](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66637156){target="_blank"} and [train
strikes](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66479059){target="_blank"} caused delayed
arrival for some.


# During the event

The issues addressed at the event fell into four broad categories:

1. [Translation](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/translation/){target="_blank"} of messages, errors, and warnings.

2. Improving [documentation](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/documentation/){target="_blank"}.

3. Addressing bug reports, such as those related to the [`stats` package](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/33){target="_blank"}.

4. Enhancements, such as [logging visual outcomes from base graphics calls](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/75){target="_blank"}. 

# Knowledge requirements for contributions

Depending on the task at hand, the technical requirements for contributions
included:

* Read R source code and understand function implementation (documentation and
translation).

* Read, modify, or write R source code (bugs and enhancements).

* Read, modify, or write C source code (bugs and enhancements).

# Workflows for contributions


During the sprint, the progress on these items was tracked [https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues){target="_blank"}. Either the initial report or the final resolution of these items may be seen in the R Bug Tracking System, known as [Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}.

Depending on the nature of the proposed change, the contributor may need
to build R from source. The instructions regarding how to do so on your personal computing
enviroment are outlined in the [R Patched and Development Versions Chapter](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/GetStart.html){target="_blank"} of the [R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/index.html){target="_blank"}. Alternatively, one could also build R from source without touching 
their local computing environment using the [GitHub Code Space
R Dev Container](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env){target="_blank"} (which I
heard facilitated collaboration nicely as well).

Regardless of whether you needed to build R from source, proposed changes could then be tested on multiple computing platforms via a pull request to [https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn){target="_blank"},
which mirrors the official base R server. After tests have passed, the contributor could 
extract the diff from the pull request to submit a proposed solution via Bugzilla.

Once a proposal is submitted,  member(s) of the R core team review. If the 
proposed change modifies the code base, additional checks are run against
all packages on CRAN (which there are currently ~20,000) to determine
if any breaking changes are enacted, which takes >14 hours to complete. If 
breaking changes are found, a possible resolution could include re-writing the code
to avoid breaking changes. If that is not possible, the R Core Team would then 
assess if the breaking changes are good breaking changes for packages (i.e., code could have been returning possibly incorrect results and should indeed break and be addressed) or if
the breaking changes have too wide of a reach and minimal impact to be considered worth it.
If it is decided that breaking changes should be enacted, the R Core Team notifies all
authors of affected packages. 



# Bugs personally addressed

I spent most of my time at the Sprint on two bugs that genuinely intrigued me
as there were related to functions I had used often over the years.

1. `base::paste` documentation, discussed in [bug 17933](https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17933){target="_blank"} and tested
in [r-devel PR138](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/138). Opened in 2020, there
was already substantial nuanced discussion on this issue related to the clarity and 
correctness of the documentation regarding the `collapse` and `recycle0` behaviors. It 
took me a substantial amount of time to understand and evaluate the scenarios discussed and propose changes. After my initial proposal, I received several rounds of feedback both from fellow R contributors and the R core team that provided additional suggestions and context
for the documentation. 

2. `stats::t.test` bug, discussed in [bug 14359](https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14359){target="_blank"} and tested in [r-devel PR142](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/142){target="_blank"}. Opened in 2010,
there was again already substantial discussion on the both the implementation of the paired
t-test and the examples shown in the documentation. This was again a collaboration
among several individuals to both modify the source code and improve documentation that
had several rounds of iteration.


# Outcomes

For both me personally and for the wider R community, I view the event as a huge
success. Many friendships were made, many collaborations were born, and many bug 
fixes and enhancements were implemented throughout the week. 

Time zone differences and personal availability among the R Core Team and contributors 
can lead to time lags in communications, losing momentum for initiated issues. Having
contributors in person together facilitated live and immediate feedback, allowing
for faster iteration and completion.

I can now confidently either submit a new bug report or address an 
existing bug report. Moreover, I understand workflows for contributions, resources for help,
and how to interact with the community for help should I get stuck. 

I will also begin attending the R Contribution Working Group (RCWG) as a representative 
of R-Ladies to communicate RCWG highlights to the broader R-Ladies community and engage
in RCWG initiatives as able.

I learned from R Core Team members that have been contributing to base R since 1997, and who knows, maybe I just shared a dinner, chatted
over coffee, or walked around campus with a future R Core Team member. 💙

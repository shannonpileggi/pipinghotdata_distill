# TL; DR

Highlights from this year include focusing on personal health and wellness,
joining the R-Ladies Leadership Team, participating in the R Project Sprint,
and teaching various workshops.

# Professional

## R-Ladies

It has been such an honor to join the Leadership Team of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/)! I am 
grateful to volunteer alongside and serve such talented, dedicated, and 
thoughtful individuals on the Leadership Team, the wider Global Team, 
and the broader R-Ladies community. To learn more about what we have been up to watch the beautiful presentation [Sustainable Growth of Global Communities: R-Ladies' Next Ten Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awTzbYXTlSc&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oRFZslRGHwHuwea7SvAATHp&index=10)
by Riva Quiroga at posit::conf(2023) and read the website [News](https://rladies.org/news/).

## R Project Sprint

I learned how to contribute to base R at the R Project Sprint in
Coventry, England. This was an amazing experience to meet in person with diverse
programmers from around the world - you can read more in my [R Project Sprint](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2023-09-07-r-project-sprint/) blog post.


## Teaching

I still really enjoy teaching, and I am grateful for the opportunities I have teach
on the side! This year I taught:
* 6 2-hour workshops for R-Ladies Meet-ups.
* A 1-day [What They Forgot To Teach You About R](https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/wtf)
workshop at posit::conf(2023), co-instructed with David Aja.
* A 3-hour [Cleaning Medical Data with R](https://shannonpileggi.github.io/rmedicine-data-cleaning-2023/) workshop at R/Medicine 2023, co-instructed
with Crystal Lewis and Peter Higgins.

## Work

I have been working at the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium since October, 2021,
and I still really enjoy it! I generally spend my days thinking deeply about data, 
coding, and how to count things. A big shift for me this year was moving to more of
a managerial role as our team grew, and I now have three direct reports. This resulted 
in a lot of code review, which includes checking for code efficiency, reproducibility, 
documentation of reasoning, understanding of the input data, confirming correct derivation of new
variables, and ensuring polished deliverables.


## Writing

This is only my 2nd blog post this year, which is an intentional drop
from previous years. I do still enjoy writing, but it is time consuming
and I did accept other responsibilities. Also, see the (personal) section. 

## Other

I attended PHUSE Connect US 2023 in person in Orlando, Florida in February (a 
Clinical Data Science Conference). This was my first conference

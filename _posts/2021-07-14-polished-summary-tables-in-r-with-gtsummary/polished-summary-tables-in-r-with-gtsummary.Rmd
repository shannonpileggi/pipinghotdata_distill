# TL; DR

The [`gtsummary`](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html){target="_blank} package in R creates amazing publication / presentation / whatever-you-need-it-for ready tables of summary statistics. Try it out!

# Background

A colleague learning R just told me that he spent 45 minutes searching for a summary table function and couldn't quite find anything that met his needs. When I showed him `gtsummary` in 5 minutes, his reaction was all

This blog post is to promote `gtsummary` and make it more searchable for those still seeking the one table to rule them all. The `gtsummary` documentation is excellent so I won't cover all of its awesome functionality, but I will add a bit of my specific experience. 

If you are still searching for your favorite table package, here are two round up resources:

1. [How to make beautiful tables in R](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/11/how-to-make-beautiful-tables-in-r/){target="_blank"} by R for the Rest of Us (2019).

2. [My favourite R package for: summarising data](https://dabblingwithdata.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/my-favourite-r-package-for-summarising-data/){target="_blank"} by Dabbling with data (2018)

# The data

I'll demonstrate with the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data; my previous post [Leveraging labelled data in R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r/){target="_blank"} has more background details. You can download the `.sav` data from my [github repo](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/tree/master/_posts/2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r/data){target="__blank"}.


```{r}
# import data ----
dat_raw <- haven::read_sav(here::here( "_posts", "2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r", "data", "sadc_2017_national.sav"))
```

# Getting started 

This material was developed using:

| Software / package  | Version               |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| R                   | 4.0.5                 | 
| RStudio             | 1.4.1103              | 
| `tidyverse`         | 1.3.0                 |
| `here`              | 1.0.1                 |
| `haven`             | 2.3.1                 |
| `labelled`          | 2.5.0                 |
| `gtsummary`         | 1.3.5                 |
| `writexl`           | 1.4.0                 |


```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # general use ----
library(here)       # file paths  ----
library(haven)      # import .sav files ----  
library(labelled)   # tools for labelled data ----
library(gtsummary)  # produce summary tables ----
library(writexl)    # export excel tables ----
```

# Data preparation

First, I import the data with `haven::read_sav()`.

```{r}
# import data ----
dat_raw <- haven::read_sav(here::here( "_posts", "2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r", "data", "sadc_2017_national.sav"))
```

Then I keep just two years of data for comparison on three question.

```{r}
dat <- dat_raw %>% 
  # two most recent years ----
  dplyr::filter(year %in% c(2015, 2017)) %>% 
  # a few variables
  dplyr::select(record, year, stheight, q12, q69) 
```

Here is a quick preview of the data.

```{r}
# print data for viewing----
dat
```

I recommend reading [Leveraging labelled data in R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r/){target="_blank"} for more details on labelled data, but for now here is a quick preview of the metadata.

```{r}
# create data dictionary ----
dictionary <- labelled::look_for(dat, details = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# view select items from dictionary ----
dictionary %>% 
  dplyr::select(variable, label, value_labels) %>% 
  knitr::kable() 
```


# The best, quickest table

To get a quick summary table, first retain only the variables you want to see in the summary table. In this case, I removed `record` to avoid summary statistics of an ID. Next, because the imported data has value labels from the `.sav` data file, I converted those variables to a factor for summarizing.

```{r}
dat %>% 
  # remove from summary table ----
  dplyr::select(-record) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to a factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(matches("q")), haven::as_factor) %>% 
  # create a table with columns for year ----
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(by = year)
```

So easy to obtain, and so readable!

And *wait* - did you see that?! The raw data had variable names of `q12`, `stheight`, and `q69` but the table printed the variable label! (I previously [tweeted](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1363186751133667330?s=20){target="_blank"} about the awesome package pairing of `haven` and `gtsummary`.) If your data does not come with handy labels, you can create them with the [`label` option in `tbl_summary`](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html){target="_blank"} or with the [`var_label` function](https://larmarange.github.io/labelled/reference/var_label.html){target="_blank"} in the `labelled` package.

# A few modifications

Here are a few modifications you might be interested in trying to customize your table, including adding an overall column, custom statistic formatting, and table styling. Note that there is an overall N that corresponds to the number of observations, and each each variable can have its own N that corresponds to the number of non-missing observations for that variable. 

```{r}
dat %>% 
  # remove from summary table
  dplyr::select(-record) %>% 
  # covert labelled values to a factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(matches("q")), haven::as_factor) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = year,
    # custom statistic formats ----
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})",
                     all_categorical() ~ "{p}% ({n} / {N})")
  ) %>%
  add_n() %>% # add column with total number of non-missing observations
  add_p() %>% # test for a difference between groups
  add_overall() %>% # add an overall column
  bold_labels() 
```

In addition, `gtsummary` makes an educated guess on  how to summarize your data and which statistical test to use. Pay attention to the footnote on the statistical tests performed and adjust if needed with the [`test` argument](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/add_p.tbl_summary.html){target="_blank"} in the `add_p` function..

# Discrete numeric values

One default I frequently correct is treatment of discrete numeric values. For example, consider a rating scale with possible values of 1, 2, 3, ... 7, but in which respondents only select values of 3, 4, 5. Making an educated guess and only seeing three unique values, `gtsummary` will treat this as a categorical variable and return frequencies of those values; however, you may still want a mean. You can override these potentially undesirable defaults in `gtsummary`. `r emo::ji("raising hands")`

This data set does not have a great example of this, so I'll make one. I am going to _pretend_ that `q12` is numeric for demonstration,

```{r}
dat %>% 
  # keep q12 for summary table ----
  dplyr::select(q12) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to numeric by removing value labels ----
  mutate_at(vars(q12), haven::zap_labels) %>% 
  # subtract one to make pretend example more realistic ----
  mutate_at(vars(q12), ~ . - 1) %>% 
  # create a table with columns for year ----
  gtsummary::tbl_summary()
```

In this table, a 4 represents carrying a weapon to school 4 days in the past month. Notice the default is to provide a frequency summary as if it is a categorical variable due the few values present. If instead you want a mean to summarize this variable, specify the variable as continuous with the [`type` argument](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html){target="_blank"} in `tbl_summary`.

```{r}
dat %>% 
  # keep q12 for summary table ----
  dplyr::select(q12) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to numeric by removing value labels ----
  mutate_at(vars(q12), haven::zap_labels) %>% 
  # subtract one to make pretend example more realistic ----
  mutate_at(vars(q12), ~ . - 1) %>% 
  # create a table with columns for year ----
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    # treat q12 variable as continuous ----
    type = list(q12 ~ "continuous"),
    # custom statistic format ----
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})")
  )
```


# Missing data

Before we part, let's make sure we understand how the package handles missing data and our options.

```{r}
dat %>% 
  dplyr::select(q69) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to a factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(matches("q")), haven::as_factor) %>% 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary()
```

This summary table tells us that there are 30,389 records in the years 2015 and 2017; 25,385 of them have non-missing values and 5,004 have missing values. The percents shown in the table are the percent of the non-missing base N; that is, 12,138 / 25,385 is 48%.

You can suppress printing the count of unknown values if you like, which does not change any of other numbers in your table.

```{r}
dat %>% 
  dplyr::select(q69) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to a factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(q69), haven::as_factor) %>% 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    # supress printing count of unknown values ----
    missing = "no"
  )
```

If you want the N at the top of the column to reflect the N for non-missing observations, I would remove those in your data cleaning process.

```{r}
dat %>% 
  dplyr::select(q69) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to a factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(q69), haven::as_factor) %>% 
  # remove all observations with missing values ----
  drop_na() %>% 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary()
```

On the other hand, if the missing data represents a valid category that you want counted, you could replace the missing values (which would shift the percentages).

```{r}
dat %>% 
  dplyr::select(q69) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to a factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(q69), haven::as_factor) %>% 
  # replace missing values for factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(q69), forcats::fct_explicit_na, "Missing weight action") %>% 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary()
```

# Outputs

`gtsummay` has a variety of [supported outputs](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html#gtsummary--r-markdown){target="_blank"}, including html and word. I work with many who prefer to see tables in excel, and this an output not _directly_ supported in `gtsummary`. (No shade here, I'm waiting patiently for this to happen in the [`gt` package](https://github.com/rstudio/gt/issues/240){target="_blank"}. `r emo::ji("grin")`)  However, `gtsummary` does have a work around available with the [`gt_summary::as_tibble()`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/as_tibble.gtsummary.html){target="_blank"} function. Save the table as an object, convert to a tibble, and then export.

```{r}
# 1 - save table ----
gt_table <- dat %>% 
  dplyr::select(q69) %>% 
  # convert labelled values to a factor ----
  mutate_at(vars(matches("q")), haven::as_factor) %>% 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary() %>% 
  # 2 convert to tibble ----
  gtsummary::as_tibble()
```

And now you can export to excel.

```{r}
# 3 - export to excel ----
writexl::write_xlsx(gt_table, here::here( "_posts", "2021-07-14-polished-summary-tables-in-r-with-gtsummary",  "example_gtsummary.xlsx"))
```

You can download the exported output `r xfun::embed_file(here::here("_posts", "2021-07-14-polished-summary-tables-in-r-with-gtsummary",  "example_gtsummary.xlsx"), text = "example_gtsummary.xlsx")`.


# Conclusion

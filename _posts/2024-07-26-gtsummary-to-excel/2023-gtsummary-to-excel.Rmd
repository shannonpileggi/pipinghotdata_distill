# TL; DR

This brief posts showcases workflows for exporting {gtsummary} tables to Excel 
(that mostly retain table formatting) via {huxtable} and {openxlsx}, optionally
with raw data.

# Introduction

In 2021, I wrote about [Polished summary tables in R with gtsummary](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2021-07-14-polished-summary-tables-in-r-with-gtsummary/), and 
[{gtsummary}](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) remains my package of choice 
for tables. I do love the default beautiful html output, but for a variety of reasons 
many of my table outputs are best delivered in Excel format. Here are newer workflows
I use to achieve this.

# Packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(gtsummary)
library(huxtable)
library(openxlsx)
```

# Excel options

Use `openxlsx` date / time options to control formatting of output date/time fields.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# format all date and date time variables in the excel output 
options("openxlsx.dateFormat" = "yyyy-mm-dd")
options("openxlsx.datetimeFormat" = "yyyy-mm-dd")
```

# Single summary table 

To render a single summary table to excel, use `as_hux_xlsx()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
t1 <- mtcars |> 
  select(mpg:disp) |> 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary() |> 
  gtsummary::bold_labels()

gtsummary::as_hux_xlsx(t1, file = "path_including_file_name.xlsx")
```

# Single summary table plus raw data

To create an excel file with a single sheet for a summary table and a sheet(s) for 
raw data listings, first use `as_hux_xlsx()`, load the workbook, and then add 
additional sheets.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
t1 <- mtcars |> 
  select(mpg:disp) |> 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary() |> 
  gtsummary::bold_labels()

gtsummary::as_hux_xlsx(t1, file = "path_including_file_name.xlsx")

wb <- openxlsx::loadWorkbook("path_including_file_name.xlsx")
openxlsx::addWorksheet(wb, sheetName = "mtcars_data")
openxlsx::writeData(wb, sheet = "mtcars_data", x = mtcars)

openxlsx::saveWorkbook(wb, "path_including_file_name.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```


# Multiple summary tables plus raw data

To create an excel file with more than one sheet for summary tables and/or a sheet(s)
for raw data listings:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
t1 <- mtcars |> 
  select(mpg:disp) |> 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary() |> 
  gtsummary::bold_labels()

t2 <- mtcars |> 
  select(hp:wt) |> 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary() |> 
  gtsummary::bold_labels()

t1_hux <- gtsummary::as_hux_table(t1) 
t2_hux <- gtsummary::as_hux_table(t2)

wb <- openxlsx::createWorkbook()
huxtable::as_Workbook(t1_hux, wb, sheet = "Table 1")
huxtable::as_Workbook(t2_hux, wb, sheet = "Table 2")

openxlsx::addWorksheet(wb, sheetName = "mtcars_data")
openxlsx::writeData(wb, sheet = "mtcars_data", x = mtcars)

openxlsx::saveWorkbook(wb, "path_including_file_name.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

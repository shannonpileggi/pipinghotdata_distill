## TL;DR

This year I was thrilled to speak at posit::conf for the first time on Context 
is King, a talk about variable labels in R. Part of my elation was due to actually 
having a talk accepted after two prior rejections on related submissions.

## Overview

I have attended six out the eight RStudio / Posit conferences, and I have
instructed a workshop at the past three. People are often surprised to hear
that up until 2024 I had actually never given a talk at this conference. It wasn't 
because I didn't try. 

In this post I share the talks I submitted and my thoughts on what went wrong,
as well as how I prepared for my accepted talk.

## Posit review process

## 2021 -- rejected

**In R:** At this point I was working in market research, where my daily workflow
included importing SPSS labelled data sets into R and doing subsequent wrangling 
and analysis. 

**Title:** _Leveraging labelled data in R_

**Abstract:** If you are at rstudio::global(2021), the thought of working with SPSS or SAS data sets may make you cringe. However, with R’s haven, labelled, and sjlabelled packages, you can leverage the inherent data labelling structure in these data sets to put metadata about your data (variable labels, value labels) right at your fingertips, making it easier to navigate data while also allowing the user to convert metadata to data. In this presentation, I will discuss general characteristics of labelled data, importing labelled data in R, storage of metadata as attributes, and practical tips for data analysis with labelled data. I will also address some potentially unexpected consequences when working with labelled data. By the end of the presentation, you may be wishing that your R workflow started with labelled data!

**My take:** The "cringe" phrasing is problematic; posit::conf is really about 
keeping a positive vibe. Also, maybe the conference committee didn't consider
SAS/SPSS users to be a wide target audience. 


## 2023 -- rejected

**In R:** I was now working in clinical research, where my daily workflow
includes importing SAS labelled data sets into R and doing subsequent wrangling 
and reporting. I had also published two blog posts since my previous submission: [Leveraging labelled data in R (2020)](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r/) (related to the 2021 submitted abstract) and [The case for variable labels in R (2022)](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2022-09-13-the-case-for-variable-labels-in-r/)
(related to this submission).

**Title:** _The Case for Variable Labels in R_

**Abstract:** Variable labels are valuable metadata providing brief descriptions of variables. Although historically associated with SAS, SPSS, or Stata data sets, variable labels can be embedded in R data frames as well. Integrating variable labels with your data requires minimal one-time effort, reduces the burden of referring to external data documentation, and alleviates the tension between succinct variable names for programming ease and longer descriptive text for interpretable output.  In this talk, I will showcase various R packages that allow you to import, assign, manage, and retrieve labels, as well as packages that automatically incorporate those labels in presentation ready outputs such as tables and figures.

**My take:** Maybe it isn't exciting? Do I sound like a robot? I state what variable
labels do but maybe not why you should be using them?

## 2024 -- accepted

**In R:** I had been doing more of the same since my previous submission. But
perhaps at this time I even more firmly believed not just that creating labelled
data is is workflow you _could_ incorporate but one that you _should_ incorporate.

**Title:** _Context is King_

**Abstract:** The quality of data science insights is predicated on the practitioner’s understanding of the data. Data documentation is the key to unlocking this understanding; with minimal effort, this documentation can be natively embedded in R data frames via variable labels. Variable labels seamlessly provide valuable data context that reduces human error, fosters collaboration, and ultimately elevates the overall data analysis experience. As an avid, daily user of variable labels, I am excited to help you discover new workflows to create and leverage variable labels in R!

**My take:** I really tried to focus on the human problems that this workflow
addresses, and I tried to pep it up.

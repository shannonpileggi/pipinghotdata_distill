## TL;DR

This year I was thrilled to speak at posit::conf for the first time ever on [Context 
is King](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/talks/2024-08-13-context-is-king/), a talk about variable labels in R. Part of my elation was due to actually 
having a talk accepted after two prior rejections on related submissions.

## Overview

I have attended six out the eight past RStudio / Posit conferences, and I have
instructed a workshop at the past three. Up until 2024, I had actually never 
given a talk at this conference. It wasn't because I didn't try. 

In this post I share the previous abstracts I submitted and how I iterated
on the submissions.

## Posit submission and review process

Submitting a talk to posit::conf requires both an abstract and a one minute
video recording^[I do not have my older video recordings, so I did not include
the submitted video recordings in this post.]. I am grateful that the posit::conf(2023) program committee wrote the blog post [How we build the posit::conf() program](https://posit.co/blog/how-we-build-the-positconf-program/). To paraphrase,
the committee is looking for talks that

1. contain actionable and impactful insights, and

2. are of broad interest.

In addition, the post provides examples of strong video submissions, which
are filmed in interesting locations, with props or engaging media, and 
provide compelling stories.

This program committee's post was published after my 2021 and 2023 rejections. Understanding
how the process works made it easier to not take the rejections personally, and to
try to figure out how to frame a new submission. 

## 2021 -- rejected

**In R:** At this point I was working in market research, where my daily workflow
included importing SPSS labelled data sets into R and doing subsequent wrangling 
and analysis. I had also recently started blogging, but I had not yet 
blogged about labelled data at the time of the submission.

**Title:** _Leveraging labelled data in R_

**Abstract:** If you are at rstudio::global(2021), the thought of working with SPSS or SAS data sets may make you cringe. However, with R’s haven, labelled, and sjlabelled packages, you can leverage the inherent data labelling structure in these data sets to put metadata about your data (variable labels, value labels) right at your fingertips, making it easier to navigate data while also allowing the user to convert metadata to data. In this presentation, I will discuss general characteristics of labelled data, importing labelled data in R, storage of metadata as attributes, and practical tips for data analysis with labelled data. I will also address some potentially unexpected consequences when working with labelled data. By the end of the presentation, you may be wishing that your R workflow started with labelled data!

**Email response:**

> Thank you for your submission to rstudio::global(2021).
Unfortunately, your submission was not accepted for a talk this year. We received a huge number of excellent submissions and could only accept a small fraction of them. It was an especially tough competition, because rstudio::global(2021) will have fewer talks than we typically have for the in-person rstudio::conf.
We know that putting together a conference submission takes significant effort
(especially putting together a video, during a pandemic) and we sincerely
appreciate the time you've invested. We hope you find a venue for your proposal
-- maybe even a future RStudio conference! Thank you again and we hope to still
see you at rstudio::global(2021).

**My take:** The "cringe" phrasing is problematic; posit::conf is really about 
keeping a positive vibe. Also, maybe the conference committee didn't consider
SAS/SPSS users to be a wide target audience. 


## 2023 -- rejected

**In R:** I was now working in clinical research, where my daily workflow
includes importing SAS labelled data sets into R and doing subsequent wrangling 
and reporting. I had also published two blog posts since my previous submission: [Leveraging labelled data in R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r/) (related to the 2021 submission) and [The case for variable labels in R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2022-09-13-the-case-for-variable-labels-in-r/)
(related to this submission).

**Title:** _The Case for Variable Labels in R_

**Abstract:** Variable labels are valuable metadata providing brief descriptions of variables. Although historically associated with SAS, SPSS, or Stata data sets, variable labels can be embedded in R data frames as well. Integrating variable labels with your data requires minimal one-time effort, reduces the burden of referring to external data documentation, and alleviates the tension between succinct variable names for programming ease and longer descriptive text for interpretable output.  In this talk, I will showcase various R packages that allow you to import, assign, manage, and retrieve labels, as well as packages that automatically incorporate those labels in presentation ready outputs such as tables and figures.

**Email response:**

>Thank you for your submission to posit::conf(2023). 
Unfortunately, your submission was not accepted for a talk this year. We received more excellent submissions than we can fit into the two days and we faced some tough decisions. In many cases, the deciding factor is creating a cohesive talk program, with a balance of topics.
We know that putting together a conference submission takes significant effort (especially recording a video) and we sincerely appreciate the time and mental energy that you invested. Thank you again and we hope to still see you at posit::conf(2023).

**My take:** Maybe it isn't exciting? Do I sound like a robot? I state what variable
labels do but maybe not emphasize enough why you should be using them?

## 2024 -- accepted

**In R:** I had been doing more of the same since my previous submission. But
perhaps at this time I even more firmly believed not just that creating labelled
data is is workflow you _could_ incorporate but one that you _should_ incorporate.

**Title:** _Context is King_

**Abstract:** The quality of data science insights is predicated on the practitioner’s understanding of the data. Data documentation is the key to unlocking this understanding; with minimal effort, this documentation can be natively embedded in R data frames via variable labels. Variable labels seamlessly provide valuable data context that reduces human error, fosters collaboration, and ultimately elevates the overall data analysis experience. As an avid, daily user of variable labels, I am excited to help you discover new workflows to create and leverage variable labels in R!

**Email response:**

> Thank you for your submission to posit::conf(2024).
We’re excited to let you know that it has been accepted as a regular, 20 minute talk!
We’ll contact you again, at this same email, in the near future to confirm your interest and get some more information from you. These next communications will also provide additional details, such as how to claim your complimentary registration (including instructions for those who have already registered), and information about the speaker training provided by Articulation, Inc.
Thanks again for your submission, we’re looking forward to hearing from you!

**My take:** I really tried to focus on the human problems that this workflow
addresses, and I tried to imbue more energy and enthusiasm in the abstract.


## Why keep trying?

Some may wonder why I persistently submitted similar abstracts three times.
It is because I feel that there is not sufficient mainstream documentation
to demonstrate workflows with labelled data. I suspect that there is a large audience 
that could benefit from either (1) workflows starting with already labelled data, or (2)
workflows that create labelled data. And since not many were talking about it,
I wanted to share what I could via posit::conf in hopes of reaching large audience. 
However, if my 2024 submission was not accepted, I doubt I would have tried on the same 
topic again.

## Reflection

Receiving multiple rejections is not fun, but in retrospect I am glad it happened
this way. The talk would not have been the same if either of the prior submissions
had been accepted. For my last submission, I focused on the human challenges we face as practitioners of data and tried my best to frame both the abstract and talk from that perspective. This is something I will carry forward if I submit again in the future; 
because really, we are all just humans trying to solve problems.

## TL;DR

This year I was thrilled to speak at posit::conf for the first time ever on [Context is King](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/talks/2024-08-13-context-is-king/), a talk about variable labels in R. 
Part of my elation was due to actually having a talk accepted after two prior rejections on related submissions.
In this post, I share the previous abstracts I submitted, how I iterated on the submissions, and briefly discuss the talk itself.

## Overview

I have attended six out the eight past RStudio / Posit conferences, and I have
co-instructed the [What They Forgot To Teach You About R (WTF)](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/workshops/2024-08-12-what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-about-r/) workshop at the past three. 
Up until 2024, I had actually never given a talk at this conference. It wasn't because I didn't try.

## Posit review process

Submitting a talk to posit::conf requires both an abstract and a one minute
video recording^[I do not have my older video recordings, so I did not include
the submitted video recordings in this post.]. The email responses to submissions from Posit are
kind but generic (so there is no personalized feedback), and I am grateful that the posit::conf(2023) program committee wrote the blog post [How we build the posit::conf() program](https://posit.co/blog/how-we-build-the-positconf-program/). To paraphrase,
the committee is looking for talks that

1. contain actionable and impactful insights, and

2. are of broad interest.

In addition, the post provides examples of strong video submissions, which are filmed in interesting locations, with props or engaging media, and provide compelling stories.

This program committee's post was published after my 2021 and 2023 rejections. 
Understanding how the process works made it easier to not take the rejections personally, and to try to figure out how to frame a new submission. 

## 2021 -- rejected

**In R:** At this point I was working in market research, where my daily workflow
included importing SPSS labelled data sets into R and doing subsequent wrangling 
and analysis. I had also recently started blogging, but I had not yet 
blogged about labelled data at the time of the submission.

**Title:** _Leveraging labelled data in R_

**Abstract:** If you are at rstudio::global(2021), the thought of working with SPSS or SAS data sets may make you cringe. However, with R‚Äôs haven, labelled, and sjlabelled packages, you can leverage the inherent data labelling structure in these data sets to put metadata about your data (variable labels, value labels) right at your fingertips, making it easier to navigate data while also allowing the user to convert metadata to data. In this presentation, I will discuss general characteristics of labelled data, importing labelled data in R, storage of metadata as attributes, and practical tips for data analysis with labelled data. I will also address some potentially unexpected consequences when working with labelled data. By the end of the presentation, you may be wishing that your R workflow started with labelled data!

**My take:** The "cringe" phrasing is problematic; posit::conf is really about 
keeping a positive vibe. Also, maybe the conference committee didn't consider
SAS/SPSS users to be a wide target audience. 


## 2023 -- rejected

**In R:** I was now working in clinical research, where my daily workflow
includes importing SAS labelled data sets into R and doing subsequent wrangling 
and reporting. I had also published two blog posts since my previous submission: [Leveraging labelled data in R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r/) (related to the 2021 submission) and [The case for variable labels in R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2022-09-13-the-case-for-variable-labels-in-r/)
(related to this submission).

**Title:** _The Case for Variable Labels in R_

**Abstract:** Variable labels are valuable metadata providing brief descriptions of variables. Although historically associated with SAS, SPSS, or Stata data sets, variable labels can be embedded in R data frames as well. Integrating variable labels with your data requires minimal one-time effort, reduces the burden of referring to external data documentation, and alleviates the tension between succinct variable names for programming ease and longer descriptive text for interpretable output.  In this talk, I will showcase various R packages that allow you to import, assign, manage, and retrieve labels, as well as packages that automatically incorporate those labels in presentation ready outputs such as tables and figures.


**My take:** Maybe it isn't exciting? Do I sound like a robot? I state what variable
labels do but maybe not emphasize enough why you should be using them?

## 2024 -- accepted

**In R:** I had been doing more of the same since my previous submission. But
perhaps at this time I even more firmly believed not just that creating labelled
data is is workflow you _could_ incorporate but one that you _should_ incorporate.

**Title:** _Context is King_

**Abstract:** The quality of data science insights is predicated on the practitioner‚Äôs understanding of the data. Data documentation is the key to unlocking this understanding; with minimal effort, this documentation can be natively embedded in R data frames via variable labels. Variable labels seamlessly provide valuable data context that reduces human error, fosters collaboration, and ultimately elevates the overall data analysis experience. As an avid, daily user of variable labels, I am excited to help you discover new workflows to create and leverage variable labels in R!

**My take:** I really tried to focus on the human problems that this workflow addresses. 
I also tried to make the title more compelling and to imbue more energy and enthusiasm in the abstract. 

## Talk preparation

After an acceptance, the real work begins.
Posit provided training by Articulation for all conference speakers, and it was a great forum to discuss ideas and get feedback.
The coach led sessions were 2 hours each, in which ~5 presenters took turns sharing their talk ideas and feedback on others'. 
Having goals at fixed timepoints helped pace the work, and I incorporated both the coach's and fellow speakers  diverse feedback at each stage.

| Time before conference | Organizer    | Meeting topic                                    |  
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |  
| 10 weeks               | Articulation | Discuss main takeaways                           |
| 7 weeks                | Articulation | Review outline                                   |
| 4 weeks                | Articulation | Present draft slides for portion of talk         |
| 2 weeks                | Articulation | Present 10 min of talk                           |
| 7 days                 | Self         | Full practice talk                               |
| 4 days                 | Self         | Follow-up to review suggested changes            |

However, at the conclusion of the Articulation session not all portions of the talk, nor the full talk, had been pressure tested.
I felt that I had tried too hard to get this talk on the program to have any obvious misses, big or small.
So after the Articulation training completed, I invited five friends (a mix of those both familiar and not with the topic) for an hour long meeting in which I presented the full talk and listened to feedback. 
It is quite sobering when you think you are "done" with a talk and realize you aren't quite there yet. üòÖ 
I am so glad I did this extra step, as every change suggested was spot on, which included some reorganization,
modification of visuals, and addition of new content.

It is hard to estimate how much time goes into preparing a talk. I worked on the talk pretty much continuously, bit by bit when I could, starting about 5 weeks before the talk until the day before the talk. 

## Why keep trying?

Some may wonder why I persistently submitted similar abstracts three times.
It is because I feel that there is not sufficient mainstream documentation
to demonstrate workflows with labelled data. I suspect that there is a large audience 
that could benefit from either (1) workflows starting with already labelled data, or (2)
workflows that create labelled data. And since not many were talking about it,
I wanted to share what I could via posit::conf in hopes of reaching large audience. 
However, if my 2024 submission was not accepted, I doubt I would have tried on the same 
topic again.

## Reflection

Despite the intense effort leading up to the talk, I did enjoy giving it. 
I was fortunate to present in the "Beautiful and Effective Tables" session alongside friends, and the room was packed. 
I am grateful some individuals took the time to share positive feedback indicating that the talk was both enjoyable and enlightening. After time has passed, it would be even more meaningful to hear that the ideas presented were actually implemented and had an impact on daily work.

Receiving multiple rejections is not pleasant, but in retrospect I am glad it happened
this way. The talk would not have been the same if either of the prior submissions
had been accepted. For my last submission, I focused on the human challenges we face as practitioners of data and tried my best to frame both the abstract and talk from that perspective. This is something I will carry forward if I submit again in the future; 
because really, we are all just humans trying to solve problems.

## Advice

Don't let rejection deter you from trying again. 
Treat the abstract and the one minute video equally seriously (I'm not sure that I did for the video for my first couple of submissions). 
Ask more than one person for feedback on your abstract and video content - everyone has a different and valuable point of view.
Think about the way the principles of your content apply broadly to a general audience.
Convince reviewers that your content can help alleviate the challenges of others.
It's easy, right? üòÇ
